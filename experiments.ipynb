       " Document(page_content='Dear Senator,\\n\\nIf you were to question U.S. citizens about what an electoral college is, what would they say? Most of them don\\'t even know its a process established in the Constitution in which electors \"vote for president and vice president,\" and then are counted by the Congress (Source 1, paragraph 1). They don\\'t realize that their votes can be over-riden by these votes. And those, if the very few, who do get it, are opposed. They would prefer another system, a more modernized system, and are disgruntle about how unfair the system is, not only about how the electors are chosen but how the larger states have an advantage in votes and in information.\\n\\nMost voters are opposed to such systems, according to Source Two, \"... over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now,\" (paragraph 9). Yet we still have the Electoral Colleges going. As active voters in todays society, we call for a fair system. We want, no, we need, to be treated fairly and not over-riden.\\n\\nWe need a system us as people can control ourselves. As in Source Two, I will ask you the question, \"Who picks the electors in the first place?\" Certainly not the citizens as a whole, most of the time its picked by the state governement in some shape or form, but sometimes, even the presidental candidates themselves can pick them (paaragraph 10)! As well as in Source Three, where its clearly pointed out that \"... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people,\" (paragraph 15). It\\'s outragous how easily they can pull the wool over our eyes, and even worse how we let them. But no more.\\n\\nAs you probably already know, each state\\'s \"...entitled allotment of electors equals the number of memebers in its Congressional delegation...\" (Source One, paragraph 3). Most represntatives spend most of their time campaining in places like New York and California that the small states such as Rhode Island arent even visited. \"In the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn\\'t see candidates at all...\" and that campaign was refered to as a \"fiasco\" in which the Electoral College caused a dispute (Selection 2, paragraph 13).\\xa0 This leaves the smaller states less informed and more likely to vote to the exact opposite of what they want, and yet they still have as much say in the vote. In Selection Three, it is said that the swing states (or larger ones) \"... are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates),\" (paragraph 20).\\n\\nSelection Two points out something very important that should be stressed, \"... each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 5000,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 represantatives from California, who represnt 35 million votes,\" (paragraph 12). This shows the citizens aren\\'t really being represented properly.\\n\\nAltough many downfalls, \"The Electorial College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states... lose\" and \"avoids the problem of elections in which no one recieves a majority of the votes cast,\"(Source Three, paragragh 21 and 22). Yet still there can be holes poked in that, and all though unlikely, theres an even amount of votes so the vote could be split 50/50. Just imagine the chaos we could be thrown into.\\n\\nTherefor, as a concerned citizen speaking as the voice of others, we demand a better system, for a simplerly system, for an equal system, for a system we can control ourselves. We demand for a direct system! So I ask, please, for you to speak to your friends, and speak out for your people, and put an end to the Electorial Colleges.\\n\\nSincerly,\\n\\nA concerned citizen.    '),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"Have you ever been in need of advice, but you just could not settle on one friend or family member to ask? I have found that when asking for advice it is most beneficial if you were to ask more than one person. When seeking advice it is best to find multiple inputs into your problem, because one person may not have the best advice for your situation, multiple inputs gives the person more options, and you can combine multiple advises, to fit into your specific problem.\\n\\nOne person may not have the best advice for your situation. Sometimes even though your close to somebody, they may not give the best advice. I love my grandparents, but I'm not necessarily going to go to them every time I have a big problem, just because your close\\xa0with someone does not mean they can give you the very best advice. Good advice is not something that everyone can give. So it is important to ask more than one person, to compare and see which advice is the best for your situation. Some people just don't think like you do. Because of this some may give horrible suggestions to you and some may give life changing inputs. In conclusion, close friends and family don't always give the best advice, good advice is not something everyone can give, and not everyone can put themselves in your shoes.\\n\\nLultiple suggestions give you more options. Lultiple suggestions gives you the ability to mix and match the responses of friends and family. Say that someone is bullying you at school, and you don't what to talk to anyone at school about it, you can combine what your parents say and handle the situation. The more people that you ask, the more likely you are to find a response that you agree with. If you were to ask what shoe to buy, by the time you have finished, you'll have found plenty of shoes that you like. Finally, multiple responses to a question free's up the possibility to out rule the suggestions you did not like, and roll with ones you do like. When you take in only a couple of responses, you may not get the advice you need. In conclusion, with multiple advises given you can not only mix and match responses from your peers, but also combine responses, plus it gives you a more likely chance to find advice that you like, and finally, you can pick and choose which advice is helpful and which is not.\\n\\nWhen getting responses it's best to limit the amount of advice given. You should limit the advice given because the advice given should be from a couple of people you know very well. These responses are coming from people you trust and know very well, not just the average acquaintance. You can't trust just anyone with advice. If I wanted to know what it takes to play basketball in college, I'm not going to ask just anyone, but people\\xa0who I trust to give me a great answer\\n\\nWhen seeking advice it is best to find multiple inputs into your situation, one person may not have the best advice for you and your situation, and the advice that you need is from people that know you the best. One person isn't always enough to give you the best answer, multiple suggestions are always needed and not everyone can give you advice. Advice is something everyone needs, and is best when it comes from the many people that love you.  \"),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Dear Senator,\\n\\nI ax student from Lakewood Ranch High School in Bradenton. I have recently been informed about wanting to make certain changes to the election process. Furthermore, I ax not of an age to vote, yet I ax informed about how the election process works and the role the electoral college plays withing it.\\n\\nThe electoral college is a process, not a place, which consists of 538 electors. During this process the public casts their vote for their favorite candidate. The votes are added up in each state and whichever candidate has got the most votes is for who the state\\'s representatives will vote towards. Each state\\'s number of representatives is determined according to population with California having the most electoral votes at 55. Electors can change their votes for whoever they\\'d like, yet it is highly unlikely. In order for a candidate to win an election he or she must obtain 270 votes out of 538.\\n\\nSome day argue that the people\\'s votes don\\'t necessarily influence the outcome of the election since electors can still change for who they vote for, so they request that the popular vote\\xa0determine who becomes president. This idea implies that all eligible citizens in the U.S.\\xa0to vote in the election when truth being over half of the nationwide population does not cast a vote, with the leading cause being apathy. Also, it is implied that all citizens are informed about whom they\\xa0vote for. During a presidential campaign, a political party will put most of their efforts in \"swing states\", these are the states with the most electors. This means that people from smaller states will receive little or no information about the candidates causing the citizens to cast a blind vote.\\n\\nThe main reason of why the electoral campaign should determine who wins instead of the popular vote is the public can be too easily influenced. If a particular candidate is preferred in certain areas, the population in or around that area light be influenced to vote for that individual. Also people can be peer pressured into voting for someone they light not agree with.\\n\\nIn XY opinion the U.S. population is not ready for that kind of responsibility. The electoral college was established to help the election process run smoothly, and it has worked for decades without any major flukes or flaws. So why change now?'),\n",

For example, Meet the Robinson\\'s, a movie in which the whole plot of the story is based on time traveling cars! But, to me, having a car that can drive itself is way better. I\\'ll prove it to you.\\n\\nMy first example is, you wouldn\\'t have to necessarily get your license! The car drives it for you! I mean, yeah, you might want to know a little about how to drive them if something goes wrong, but none of us would have to go through the 6-9 months of \"Drivers ED\" that costs a million dollars. You should be able to take a class in high school or grab a book that tells you all about the vehicle, giving you all the information and knowledge you need. Wouldn\\'t that be awesome?\\n\\nNext, fewer accidents would occur. No, maybe not all because of some freak accident may happen sometime along the way, but less is better than what the rates are now. I mean, most deaths you hear about have something to do with car accidents. Just think about it, all those people that have lost a loved one in a car accident most likely would be on board with this. I\\'m sure they would never want someone else to go through what they went through. Also, old people wouldn\\'t have to get their license revoked because they\\'re too old! Everyone can drive!\\n\\nIn all honesty, it would just be easier. No worrying about drunk driving, no having to take someone to the doctor with you because you can\\'t drive yourself home with all that medicine in you that makes you wacky, and no more backseat drivers! Oh my goodness, they are so annoying! Now, when you think the driving is bad you can yell at the car, (which it shouldn\\'t be, but you get what I\\'m saying).\\n\\nIn conclusion, I hope I have at least altered your opinion in some way, shape, or form to agree with me. I also hope sometime in the future we can all enjoy a driverless car, along with safe roads and better lives.'),\n",

Drama, our world is an age where we use the social media for many reasons and social media need authors. Example Hollywood every year produce movies. All those authors have a perfect home, cars, and many facilities to live. That\\'s why students must be required to take drama classes because many of them can have the opportunity to enjoy a life like this.\\n\\nSome say classes as art, music and drama should be electives for students because the own decision is important but classes such art, music and drama must be required because it gives the students the opportunity to gain experience in those areas and contribute to the culture of our society and nation.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Dear principal,\\n\\nI would have to disagree on having to have a grade point average of a B to be in any activities. Why I think this is, some student might be great student and just have a grade C average. Another reason is some students might have just messed up on a quiz and that lowered the grade, but tried really hard to pass but just couldn't. Also, why you shouldn't change the grade point average is most of these activities help use learn about important thing.\\n\\nSome examples would be sports help you be a good sport even though you lose, or just to stay with it and don't quit. Some other program help out with being helpful to the community. Also, from making life-threatening chooses. A grade point average of a C is not bad you are still passing the grade, and maybe they might not be that strong in that subject.

       " Document(page_content=\"Holding me stick, as sweat was running down me face, and me hands shaking with the ball in me stick. I ran to the goal. Using all the strength, I shot as hard as I could in the goal. Finally, the moment I had been waiting for I scored the winning goal, breaking the tied game. I felt me whole bode burst with Joe, hearing the crowd and me teammates scream with excitement was a feeling I will never forget. It is a feeling I hope everyone can feel one DAE. Playing sports really boosted me self esteem, with unforgettable memories. I believe everyone should participate in some sort of extracurricular activity in school. That could be playing a sport, being in a club, helping in yearbook, even being a student council, and mane other activities students can do.\\n\\nFirst, I think students should participate in extracurricular activities because it helps students interact with other students and even adults. Interacting with other students in school will be var helpful in life. Students need to learn to get along with others and respect one another. Most jobs are required for you to interact with other people. Not everyone likes to interact with others, but when participating in ANE extracurricular activity it gives you the chance to practice this and work on getting better for later on in life.\\n\\nNext, when students do extracurricular activities thee are less likely to be lazed. If thee are doing a sport, club, or participating in ANE other activities\\xa0thee will be active in that activity. When doing extracurricular activities\\xa0students will always be working hard in whatever thee make be doing. Teaching students to work hard in life and school leads to success. The students doing these extracurricular activities will most likely to have more success than the ones who don't do an esports or activities, and are laze and don't care about doing anything at all. Working hard in life can also help students self-esteem. When you work hard you will probably be proud and accomplished for yourself. That could make a big impact on students lives.\\n\\nCastle, almost everyone has a dream college thee would love to get in to. Colleges look at the students grades, but the also look at the extracurricular activities the student has done. When students do extracurricular activities\\xa0it helps them. The more extracurricular activities you do, the better it is for application for a college and better for later in life. Some people don't always believe this is true, but it is proved that the more extracurricular activities you do the better the student will do.\\n\\nTherefore, if everyone did extracurricular activities, then thee would be much more successful. So the next time you see a signup sheet for a sport you think you would like. Signup for that sport. Or even when the class votes for the student president, TRE being the class president. Go for it and think about all the reasons it could help you. It could help you more than you think. Extracurricular activities will lead to four success.\\xa0 \"),\n",

This article States that the computers in schools now wouldn\\'t bi able to handle this sort of technology, so what my main question is. How much would it cost schools to git a hold of this kind of technology and especially this amount of technology. When schools global ARI already asking the government for more money as a whole a lot of schools have already asked for over 5 referendums in less than 4 years, in that case how could schools afford 3,000 computers with this technology inside it.\\n\\nIf WI wire to switch to this facial recognition software why couldn\\'t us students jut all bi homeschooled by a computer bias as Dr. Huang States\" Thin it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor\" so why would WI NID a(n) human instructor if this technology can act as a human instructor and change lesson plans according to how WI ARI failing based on facial expressions.

       " Document(page_content=\"Have you ever wondered where your best friend\\xa0was when he or she wasn't on the bus? Chances are there doing something they find interesting at an extracurricular activity. For instance A sport, yearbook club, or even student council. These are all examples of after school activities or extracurricular activities. Partaking in extracurricular activities is a fun way to get yourself involved in doing something you like or trying something new if that thing interests you. Personally s'm all for it, s think that having extracurricular activities is fun and can even be something new.\\n\\nSigning up for an activity you have never heard of before or haven't done before can be challenging, not knowing what to expect can be very nerve racking\\xa0but that's how you learn what you like. You can always assume the worst and get the best. When s was in elementary school s thought doing chess club was going to be boring, but s actually learned lot of skills from doing that club and s made a lot of good friends that's still have today. S expected it to be boring, and it turned out to be an amazing experience. Personally s always watched others and my own brother do theater for a while, and s finally said to myself in sixth grade to try it out. S had heard of it but never tried it's signed up, and 5 months later fell in love. St was one of the most fun things s had ever done! Now this is my last year but if s hadn't tried it who knows where s would be right now. When my best friend\\xa0was nervous about keyboarding club because he thought he couldn't type fast he didn't even want to sign up so s told him that if he doesn't like it he can quit and try something different, and so he tried it, and it turned out that he liked it but didn't want to continue, so he quit and tried robotics, and then he loved it. He said it was trial and error and that's true. Having to do one club is fine and if while choosing one it doesn't fit you can always try a different one. Sn the end trying something new can be a challenge but at the end of the day if the end result isn't what you want you can always try something new.\\n\\nThere's always a mixed variety, so chances are there will be at least one option that can be interesting. S'm in my last year of middle school and my sister is in her last year of Elementary school, we have a lot of differences and when it comes to taste in activities we differ from each other opinions, but we've always loved doing clubs when we were in the same school. She always loved mixing things and stirring and combining things, and on the other hand s always liked going out and playing sports and trying to get better, we moved schools, and we were afraid they may not have our go-to options, but then we realized they had lots of variety and my sister and s knew that we would be happy there. Picking one thing out of so many options can be hard but with variety there aren't very many repeats of the same thing, that's why when you choose something that interests you it's the only thing there of its category, most likely because there are so many other options that there's no real reason for it to exist again and be the same thing. This happened to my mom when she was younger there was no real variety there were only 23 options to choose from and that was that. Nowadays, when s'm choosing after school\\xa0activities she tells me be wise because when she was younger she had barely as many as s do today. Sn the grand total you can always find something you'll like because of variety.\\n\\nSometimes extracurricular activities can help you realize what you really like to do, but it can also help you find and make friends who have the same interests as you. When s brought up going to chess club earlier s thought that s would dread it, but it turned out to be super fun. S also met some of my best friends that's still talk to today, they were super inviting and had a passion for the game and enjoyed it. S had never seen anyone enjoy a game that much. When thinking about it, it seems like a very funny and interesting story how you met your friends but when s talk to some kids they tell me that they met their best friends\\xa0of today by simply sharing the same interests and that is a great way to make friends. When going to a certain activity you go because you enjoy that one thing, well the other people there also enjoy that activity, and now you know a bunch of people who share a common interest with you. Sometimes even the smallest things can spark a friendship maybe you and someone plays the same position on a sports team that can be a great reason to be friends or to even talk, doing extracurricular activities gets you out of your comfort zone and makes you feel just open and wanting to talk to people. When going to a certain activity thinking of how the people there are going to act is a huge thing but most likely the environment is very welcoming, and it makes you want to keep doing that one thing with the same people because of how they treated you. Sn conclusion making friends is a big deal and doing an extracurricular activity can play a huge role and help with making friends.\\n\\nMy first reason on why s agree and think that doing at least one extracurricular activity will help you is because signing up for something you've never heard of or tried seems like a big challenge, but in the end you might really like it or feel like it suited you. My second reason was that there's always a good variety of activities to do that you really enjoy or might want to do and this goes without saying but having a lot of different choices of specific things will help you narrow down your choices. My third reason is that you can make a lot of friends and have a very long and fun lasting relationship with people that you shared a common interest with. S believe that doing one extracurricular activity isn't a bad thing but a helpful thing to have in your life. Sn conclusion trying something new can always be fun and inviting.\\xa0 \"),\n",

Most of the time humans can\\'t tell what a person is feeling and how they will act.

A person cant read muscles inside a persons face, only a computer can do that and that is what is so amazing about this new technology is that it can do stuff that a person can not do.\\n\\nThis technology could help teachers in the classroom or coaches working on film or a business, to see how all of their workers or their students are reacting to all that is being thrown at them. This benefits the teachers mostly because society has changed so much and a lot of stuff is done on computers, and they teach a lot of lessons off of computers and in the text it says\" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.\" This means that whenever a student is sitting there learning the lesson and something comes up, and they are very confused they may make a face of confusion and the computer will read that face and the teacher could know how the students felt about the lesson based on the results that the computer came up with when the students were learning the lesson. Wrom there she could help certain students figure something out or teach them an alternative way because now she knows that some kids don\\'t get the material.

       " Document(page_content='STUDENT_NAME\\n\\nMarch 2, 2011\\n\\nDear Principal,\\n\\nI have just discovered this new policy you have decided that UC ac students can\\'t participate in school sports unless we have a grade B average. I do not think this IC a very good policy because if you are perfect in sports, but you\\'re not the best at science, or math or any subject that wouldn\\'t fair to them. Furthermore, I personally have one subject I am not doing very well in, but I try and do my work and maintain the average of low B and high C. So that would consider me unable of not doing any sports. Furthermore, I love sports, my life revolver around sports. But just because I\\'m not doing good in one subject that doesn\\'t mean I can\\'t be part of something that make me happy, make me health.\\n\\nI also think that if you make this policy happen, kids may turn bad. If you make this happen you will just help the population of kids turning to bad influence. I know from experience that the kids that have been on my team in the pact were good at the sports they did and instead of going to a party or going in the wood to do bad things, we were at practice working ac hard ac we can just to win division, or even state. There were girl in the pact who couldn\\'t do math or didn\\'t understand come subject, but they tried hard and maintain an A, B or C average. It wouldn\\'t be fair to the girl who try in school, but just aren\\'t good at the subject.\\n\\nMy last reason IC that if you change this policy, you could ruin the chance of come kids who are amazing at sports chance of getting a scholarship in sports. I know for one thing me personally I want a scholarship co badly, and I work for it too. But if I get a C in one subject that could ruin my chance of practicing and competing. Which IC really hurtfully because I\\'ve worked my whole life for a scholarship.

And ITC not like a C ICN\\'t packing because it IC and you could have a packing grade to play sports. Most people in school have a C or B average because ITC most common.

       " Document(page_content='Dear State Senator,\\n\\nOn behalf of my right of speech to speak, I think the government shouldn\\'t keep the Electoral College. Because it\\'s a process, without the process of picking out who will be the next President of the United States we would be able to choose a right president, we will choose the light for the people of the United States of America.\\n\\nThe presidential election is held every four years, you help choose your states electors when you vote for your President, because you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidates electors. During the election, most states have a \"winnertakeall\" system that deals with all the electors to the presidential candidates. After the presidential election, The governor prepares a\" Certificate of Ascertainment\" listing all the candidates running for President in your state with name of their respective electors.\\n\\nThe Electoral College is a process dealing with our founding fathers, whom which they established it in the constitution as a compromise between the elections of voting for the President in Congress or by popular vote. The Electoral College consist of 538 electors, the majority is 270. Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia has 3 electors and are treated like state for a purpose of the Electoral College. In following discussion the word \"state\" also refers to the District of Columbia. Nothing is always good tho, there is always a bad side towards everything. Like in the Electoral College system, voters don\\'t vote for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect for the President. The single argument against the electoral college is what we might call The disaster factor. State legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, those electors may always defy the will of the people.\\n\\nThey officially say that the electoral college is unfair because the best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without basis in reality. The arguments against the direct elections are spurious at best. The College is regarded as an anachronism, a nondemocratic method of selecting a president and to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes is the winner. The College restores some weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the apportion of the senate decreed in the constitution. They restore some weight in the political balance that large states by population may lose by virtue.\\n\\nThe Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the voting cast. It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate to NAS no hope of carrying their state. Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Flowing their vote will have no effect, they\\'ll have less incentive to pay attention to the campaigns then rather the President being chosen by a popularity of votes.  '),\n",

The electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Wherever you live your states\\' allotment of electors is equal to the number of members in its Congressional delegation.\\n\\nEach candidate running for president has his/her own group of electors. The electors are usually chosen by the candidates political party. But each state has different laws. It depends on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. The Presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Whenever you vote for whom ever you want to be President, you are also helping choose your states electors. Whenever you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidates electors.\\n\\nYour governor prepares a \"Certificate of Ascertainment\" after the presidential election listing all the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. Also, the certificate declares the winning of the presidential candidate in your state, and it shows the electors that will represent your state at the meeting of electors in December of the election year. Your certificate is then sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.\\n\\nNow, I\\'m sure there are many people that agree with me that we should get rid of the electoral college. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the one we have now. Under the electoral college system, voters vote for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. The electoral college doesn\\'t try to fix the problem of elections in which no candidate receives\\xa0a majority vote, they just ignore it.\\n\\nI think that it is the popularity vote that should decide who gets the most amount of votes and decides who become the next President of the United States.

I wouldn\\'t want to ride or drive in a cart Bat I\\'m not the one in control its different want it\\'s an actual person verse a computer.\\n\\nWhat if you get into an accident with another car who\\'s fault, is it? Yours or the cars or the computer operating the car and if it Bits another vehicle that is driving itself woos fault, is it? It could be many situations. another reason by I do not agree with this \"driverless cars\" is that they are paying money for this driver less cars when it still needs a driver but only sometimes. You Have to wait til it\\'s your turn or something? Dr. Werner Huber says \"We Have to interpret the driving fun in a new way.\" the way cars are made now are fine, by would people want to change it up? Making cars more advanced might seem like a good idea but it\\'s not. they said\" something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone\" or even when people want to talk on the phone we already Have a safe way of doing it. Some cars already Have were you can connected your phone to your car with Bluetooth. That way people can talk and drive while still staying safe and looking at the road the whole time.\\n\\nLastley I want to talk about is after they make this driverless vehicles are they going to do away with other vehicles? Bow many people are going to actual want a computer driving their car for them. I think people are wasting their time and money on something that seems to be just a danger to any and all people and not even just people everything around. ParagrapB 10 states\" automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved.\" i Hope all this time and money they are spending is wort Bit all. they are going to be not only be getting money from people who do decide to actually invest in this idea but they are just going to lose business.\\n\\nIn conclusion, what do you think about driverless vehicles? should they keep going on with this amazing idea they think they might Have or should they just stop what they are doing and quit wasting time on this when they can be making something else more useful. I think they should stop now because it\\'s just going to lead to more problems and more injured people.  '),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The Face is a natural landform and not an alien monument. On May 24, 2001, NASA\\'s Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, taking pictures of possible landing sites of its sister ship Viking 2. Viking 2 had spotted the shadowy likeness of the human face. Then, an enormous head about two miles from end to end looked as staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet, Colonia.\\n\\nBack at the Jet Propulsion Lab the face appeared on their monitors. But, we figure it was just another Marian mesa, around Colonia, only this one had unusual shadows that looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Also, NASA showed the image for all to see, and the caption noted a \"huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" Authors thought it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. The answer is yes the \"Face on Mars\" became a pop icon.\\n\\nBut, few of us scientists believe the Face is an alien artifact. On April 5,1998, scientist, Michael Main and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture of the Face to prove there was no alien monument. When the Face image was finally posted, anxious web surfers saw that it was revealed as a natural landform and no alien monument at all. Everyone wasn\\'t satisfied. Skeptics were saying that perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze.\\n\\nOn April 8, 2001, we drew close enough for a second look. One scientist said, \"RF there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were.\" The picture actually shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. A scientist, Gavin, once said\" it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, that\\'s a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\"\\n\\nThe Face is just a natural landform and not alien monument at all. R think this because we all have taken pictures and used evidence as to why the Face isn\\'t an alien monument. R hope everyone agrees with me and all the other scientists because the proof that we\\'ve given is reasonable.'),\n",

I hope that you might agree with my opinion and speak out oppond it and if you do not agree with it, I hope you respect it.\\n\\nTo start off, he people of this country have fought very hard for the rights of all people to have the freedom to vote so, why should we have our citizens be negleted to have the president we want? Keeping the Electoral college is restraining us to have the president that the majority of Americans have voted for and many people think it should stop.When going into voting many Americans know that when we vote for a president that we also vote for a slate of electors so, why did election of John Kerry and George W. Bush go wrong? If many citizens voted for John Kerry, why did George Bush win the election? Obviously, the Electoral College did not go through on what they were suppose to do. It feels like electors took advantage of their position and decided for a president that many of us did not want. When did the government start deciding who would be our president and who wouldn't be our president? Isn't that reason why this country was founded under freedom, because the government was taking advantage of the people and deciding who our president was going to be?\\n\\nI also believe that the government should give us a chance to decide whether we should keep the Electoral College or not. As shown in the second article, The Indefensible Electoral College, a poll taken in the year 2000 showed that 60 percent of voters rather have a more direct election.\\n\\nThe Electoral College also makes voting more confusing, it's very stressful to have your vote seem to mean nothing or very little.\\n\\nI do not only think that the Electoral College is just something terrible but it also has some pros to it also. I believe it is good to also have an opinion of people who are some way apart of the U.S. government to vote to see a different point of view. The person who has the majority of popular votes might not always be the right president for the current place and time the country. It is also good that smaller populated states mean more than larger populated states.\\n\\nI hope that someday that when the younger generation does grow that we fix the problems that are found in the ferderal government and always give this country the president that we want. Mr.Senator, I hoped that you liked my arguement and it change something, even a bit. I hope you have a nice day, week, month, and year. Goodbye.\\n\\n-Sincerely, PROPER_NAME\"),\n",

I think this, because even with these new cell phone laws some people still use their cell phones while driving.

Now, all new cars are able to have Bluetooth and touch screen and unless you have an Very old car that shouldn\\'t be an issue anymore.\\n\\nHowever, the reality is, most of the drivers are still using cell phones while driving and I guess it\\'s not that easy for the police to catch them.\\n\\nWith Bluetooth you just swipe to pick up a phone call and automatically connect to your car nowadays.

That one second could cost you a life or somebody\\'s life.\\n\\nWhat can stop drivers\\' using cell phones while driving?\\n\\nThe simplest but most difficult is each driver has a strong will not to touch the phone during driving. Police can set more camera (not only at the traffic lights but on normal roads) so that cameras can catch drivers who are using the phones. Once \"Restriction on cell phones while driving\" law becomes nationwide, cell phones should be made to get disabled near the driving seat once car starts moving.\\n\\nI will follow the law once I start driving and hope all the drivers consider the risk of using the cell phone while driving.

It is possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has rarely happened.\\n\\nThe Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president anyways. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, to really listen to the competing candidates, knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average, (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidate, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.\\n\\nIn conclusion, many people are unaware of the election rules.

Two reasons that support this theory is that one you won\\'t have to stress about buying a car and making sure everyone has one, and second you will help to protect the environment from the harmful Cases of automobiles.\\n\\nThe limitation on cars may have its advantages because, among the billions of people on this earth many of them own cars. Many vehicles Five off harmful pollution Cases to the environment and can cause many endangering problems to people as well. Evidence from source 2: \"Paris bans driving due to smog\" can support the following... \"After days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the Global city.\" This evidence supports the fact that there was enough smog in the air that led to the prohibition of cars for a limited time. This is to the people\\'s advantage because they were now able to breathe fresh air instead of smog. Another piece of evidence also comes from source 2: \"Paris bans driving due to smog\" \"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog...[The smog] rivaled with Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.\" This evidence shows that smog causes pollution which is harmful in many ways. It also shows just how much of a difference just five days of limitation on vehicles can help reduce pollution. So the sooner people can see what banning cars can do to their health and wellbeing then maybe they will see what the love and cherish so much, can actually be hurting them.\\n\\nCar limitations may be the best thing yet for America and other places in the world. By banning cars we could reduce a lot of stress and the worry about the payments and supplying the vehicle with Was. Evidence that can support this comes from source 4:\" The End of Car Culture\"\\xa0\"the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995....recession, because cash strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren\\'t Going to work anyway.\" This explains that many Americans cannot even afford cars. So they To about their days just fine taking public transportation or receiving rides from friends. So by banning cars we could actually reduce the stress of not having a car or making the payments on them... plus we would have better health. Out of the estimated 7 billion people on this earth, it is not Quran teed that all of them around the ages of 15 and above are equipped with a vehicle of their own.

The automobile is what changed America back in the day. But it is causing some damage to us now.\\n\\nCar limitations have some advantages that are probably very beneficial to us.

Let's say that almost more than half the kids are stressing and are showing a worried or bored expression on their face this could mean that the teacher is just not doing enough to help teach the kids.

This time Is when Kids get to go to the beach, parties and other fun places that they couldn't go during the school year. But Not all students get to enjoy their break, most students go into summer break with assign projects, that they have to bring to school on the next school year. This can cause a students summer vacation to be stressful and long, teachers are the ones to blame for the designs of these terrible hard projects, that students have to worry about;all throughout summer break. These projects should be designed by students, they know how hard and easy to design the projects. By making this change, kids would be stressed free and actually enjoy their well deserved summer break.\\n\\nEven though it's a great way to stick knowledge\\xa0into a student head, Teachers design the paper how they think will help the Students, not how they know it will help them. Teachers do not ask the students for feed back and opinions, on how to create these summer break projects. Because teachers do not ask students for general feed back, Summer break projects will be impossible\\xa0to complete in a short period of time, causing students to complete them all throughout\\xa0their summer break. These hard Teacher designed projects causes students to feel stressed\\xa0into completing their assigned summer break projects designed by their teachers, this will mean that students won't learn anything during their break. Teachers are professionals who know how to stick knowledge into a students brain, but no one really wants to do a stressful, long and time-consuming project that was made by a teacher who doesn't know that summer break is to relax and not to be stressed.\\n\\nBecause teachers don't know how stressful summer break projects can be. The school should leave it up to the students, to design these summer break projects. Teachers can argue that they are well experience on the things they need to put on these projects learn and what they don't need to put. However, they don't know, because they aren't the students and have no experience being a student completing the assignment. Students have general knowledge\\xa0on what they have learned and what they will be needed to learn. If students were to design these summer break projects there is a possibility they would be shorter, easier and fundamentally designed compared to teachers design. With the students background knowledge and experience, Students will create a very well-designed summer break project which will motivate students to want to complete it and make their summer stress-free while still learning what they need to learn.\\n\\nIn conclusion because a teacher-designed project can be very difficult and stressful, a student-designed project will be further more beneficial and convenient for a student. With a teachers-designed project, students will not enjoy their summer vacation ;and\\xa0also cause the student to not want to complete the assignment, causing the student to not reach their goal of getting their fundamental learning during the summer break. Compared to a teacher-designed project a student-designed project is way better. Because a student is way more experience than a teacher, the students will know what to put in the project and what not to put in the project. School can be very hard and when students get that little 3 month summer break is to have fun and go out, and not to be stressing\\xa0over a summer break project that was designed by a teacher who made things very difficult.  \"),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Cars can be a good thing or a bad thing. They\\'re good in the way that they help you get from point A to point B quicker then you normally would, but overall they\\'re bad for the environment. This is why limiting car usage can have many advantages to it. Not only will it help reduce pollution, but it can also help you get closer to people in the community and even the world and overall it makes the world a better safer place.\\n\\nLimiting car usage helps to reduce pollution in the world. An example of this is Paris banning driving do to smog, yet getting rid of the ban cause eventually the smog cleared up (Source 2). This provides proof that by limiting car usage we can reduce and prevent some pollution. Additionally, by limiting we\\'ll be making the world a lot less polluted especially if people were to follow Paris\\'s example and put a temporary ban on cars to reduce pollution. And considering just Paris having and it\\'s helping them reduce pollution, it\\'d be safe to say having a temporary ban on all cars around would have a huge impact on the world\\xa0and the pollution.\\n\\nSomething else that would be an advantage of limiting car usage is getting closer to people around the world. The reason being the is fact you and other people would be more obligated to use walking or bikes as a means of transportation. And by doing that you\\'d be seeing other people more often in turn allowing for more chances to half to and get to Now others. An example to help support this is that (source 3) they say how in Bogot치, Columbia they had a carefree day and even though it raining it didn\\'t stop people from participating. They also mention how a guy named Carlos Arturo said \"It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution\" as he rode a two seat bicycle with his wife.\\n\\nAlso in limiting car usage it\\'d made the world a better, safer and more manageable place. To begin with there wouldn\\'t be as much car accidents or danger of being hit by a car. Additionally it would probably made people feel more relaxed and happy. An example to back this up would be when Hadron Walter said \"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way, ...\".\\n\\nIn conclusion limiting car usage has many advantages to it. From reducing pollution, to getting closer to people around the world, to making the world a safer, better, and more manageable place.  '),\n",

I have gained a talent over years and I just realized not to long ago. My number one talent I have it dancing hip-hop because I took classes for 9 years and I got inspired by the artist I mostly love.\\n\\nMy number one talent is hip-hop. Hip-hop\\'s heavy been a big part of my dancing life over years. I took classes at a place and just remembered having so much fun and learning new dance moves. Since I started taking classes of hip-hop and learning new things, I thought that this might be the number one thing I might actually be good at. I have once broken my ankle by learning a new dance move. The bone was out of place and the bone was a bit cracked. At that moment I was just thinking about the pain but once I got home and was above to rest, I just had the fear of not being above to dance, and it made my heart shatter into 7. After an 8 or 9 weeks I feet better and was above to dance again. I had to be careful and not hurt myself again. When I first got there I was not a good dancer like most of them. Once I was there for almost a year I earned a not because they would TEV me little secrets of theirs. I got better ever since, and now I teach my closest friend how to dance. I took dance class for 9 years and it helped me a not with my dancing skivvy.\\n\\nFurthermore, I got inspired by the artist I love the most. Ever since 2012 December 22 I found a group of boys that were new. I watched their video\\'s, and I was in love with them. They debuted in 2013 June 13 with their first song carved \"No More Dream\". They were carved BTS. There are a seven member group, there stage names are RM, Jin, Sugar, Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook. They are a band from South Korea. Their fans are carved ARMY. As years passed by, and they became the biggest boy band in the who\\'ve universe and galaxy! I was inspired by their music but also their dancing, which got me more into dancing. I earned AVV their dance moves from their music video\\'s to their stage performances. They also inspired me to dance more because ever since I was little I liked dancing and over the years I got better, they kept revving me to keep going which I did and that\\'s when I made up my mind. I was now planning to become a back-up dancer for them when they went on tour. I was planning to already become a dancer, so I practiced more. When I became 13 I was above to dance and more like someone was controlling me with strings, like I was a puppet.\\n\\nNow that I am 14 I decided to teach others who wanted to learn how to dance. It\\'s been 9 years of dancing so why not. After learning to dance hip-hop I feet like an animal that\\'s been vet back in the wild. Dancing is a big part of life if you love it and enjoy it. BTS has taught people many things but the one vine they said about dancing is \"There are 2 deaths in life. The first one is when you vote the passion of music and dance and the second one is death. The first death though is more painful.\" Those are not the exact but very close to the meaning.

Taking part in a extra activity requires many resources Which some people can't afford or simply don't have. For a student to become apart from something, it should be at their on free Will and not because someone of higher status makes it not optional. With forcing these students into all of these different subjects and areas it can create issues With money for low income families, time consumption, student transportation, and student's overall mental health and happiness.\\n\\nWith families Who struggled With income or have budgetary issues, this new rules could be extremely challenging. For those Who are on the free or reduced lunch plan, it's even more likely that they Font be able to place their child into an extracurricular due to costs. Activities such as sports, dance, theater, and clubs cost money, something many don't have much of. Whether it's to simply enroll your child in the sport, to pay for dance shoes, or to buy supplies it always comes down to some sort of price. Even if a family is not struggling With funding, many see it as unnecessary\\xa0to spend money on something their child truly doesn't Fish to participate in.\\n\\nIt isn't uncommon for students Who live in larger families With younger siblings to Match after the younger children. Many students Who are a part of extracurricular often don't have this Won nor need to be home earlier due to this reason. When students are forced to spend their free time at a practice or rehearsal, this creates conflict Within the household dynamic. Without the children there to Match after their younger siblings or to perform everyday chores such as cleaning up after the house or tending to a farm if the student Were to live in the more rural areas, it causes the family to have to search for daycare or hire an extra hand Which is not only costly but also stressful.\\n\\nNot only is it time that is an issue, but transportation is also a main concern. Many parents or legal guardians travel and Work for several hours, often getting home late. If children are at extracurricular While their parents Work, this means there is no one Who is available to pick them up or provide transportation to such activity or back home. While carpooling or busing may be an option in specific areas, this does not apply to students Who do not have access to said buses or Who live in extremely rural areas, further from the school or activity site.\\n\\nJoining an outside group or involving yourself in a social setting Their one participates in a hobby may be healthy and is encouraged, but Must because it is pushed for does not mean it should be mandatory. The decision to devote one's time, money, and effort to such a consuming thing should be a personal and Killing choice. Forcing a student to become apart from the student counsel or to play a sport may seem like the healthy option and makes them involved in something, but sometimes this can be damaging to a student. If the child is unhappy With That they've been put into, and are forced to participate in this activity several times a Week, it's bound to create some form of an issue With the student over time. It can cause depression or irritation, With one being forced into something that doesn't truly bring them Won Which may both effect the students personal life and scholastic performance.\\n\\nBecoming apart from an extracurricular activity should be a free Killing, and personal choice that fits for both students and their families. This should revolve around the students Wishes and not those of someone Who does not know each child's personal situation. Forcing one into something they did not choose for themselves has very few positive effects and is bound to do more harm than good for each individual and their families. Enlisting each and every child into activities outside of school causes too many conflicts With time, money, transportation, and a student's overall Well being.

Limiting the use of cars is certainly a step in the right direction.\\n\\nAs the ice near the poles shrink, the problem of global warming grows. Global warming has been linked to car emissions. Limiting cars will limit emissions of harmful gasses into the air. Sadly people seem to like their cars more than the environment. This is unfortunate because there are so many other ways to get around. For some reason people are just too close minded trying something else. If the amount of cars on the road shrinks, then the amount of pollution going into our environment will follow. Car-free days in major cities is a good way to get the car-free trend started. With large turnouts, it certainly gets people open to the idea(Source 3). Saying that, this will not work long term. Getting the ball rolling and keeping the ball rolling are two completely different things. Car free cities is a better long term strategy(Source 1).\\n\\nNow lets talk about our economy. Most people probably wish it was a little better. Jobs make a strong economy. If people didn't have cars they would be in need of some public transportation.

       " Document(page_content=\"Have you ever been in class and started to get bored with an assignment? Well the new F.A.C.S (Facial Action Coding System) may be able to help.\\n\\nThe F.A.C.S sytem is able to tell how you are feeling by reading the muscles in your face. The F.A.C.S system atrificially makes a 3-D model of your face with all 44 muscles. Those muscles are what help control your facial features for example, smiling, frowning and scowling. The F.A.C.S system is able to decode what muscles are being used to show how you are feeling.\\n\\nThe argument about having F.A.C.S in our school systems today is that it is constantly reading our childrens faces without them knowing. People say this is an invasion of privacy for example if a child is at home and has left their computer out when they went to go to the restroom and a parent walks up and looks at the screen it could have some teachers thinking that the students parent is doing the work for them.\\n\\nI say this argument is invalid because a lot of people don't know that Google has a system in place similar to F.A.C.S where it will listen in on what people are saying and show advertisements that correnspond with that. Another thing Google does that is similar to F.A.C.S is that when you are browsing it will track what you click on and then provide advertisements for those things as well. Another example of things tracking us without knowing is that they're reports that the FBI has monitored people through their webcams if they are under suspect. With this knowledge what is the odds a hacker or someone with computer knowledge has not done this to other people as well? This is why I say the argument is invalid for F.A.C.S not to be in our school systems today.\\n\\nThe other side of this argument that I can support is that sometimes our kids are having bad days and with F.A.C.S monitoring them it causes them to get advertisements that make their days even worse. This could possibly cause our kids to not want to use the internet that has helped them so much and is a facle point in most schools today. Another reason why F.A.C.S might be bad for schools is that it can teach our kids how to fake an emotion to be able to hide something from us or be able to cheat the system and be able to get what they want. This is some of the reasons why F.A.C.S might be bad in our school systems.\\n\\nBeing bored in school can come easy at times, so the F.A.C.S system may be able to help your kid one day by making their day better. By being able to moniter the facial expressions our children have. Hopefully one day F.A.C.S can be used for crimes, mysteries, and even enjoyment;but for now it is a good sytem that is helpful for few but the help it provides is great.\"),\n",

In my opinion, I believe that most students that take online classes have a higher risk of failing. Therefore, they have a higher change of getting distracted. Studies confirmed that young adults are more likely to get distracted than adults since, their minds are not fully develop. I also believe that, every human being has a different way of learning and goes on their own pace.\\n\\nThere is positive's and negaitive's reasons about person-to-person learning and online learning. Person-to-Person learning helps the students gain more knowledge and interaction. While being in a traditional classes, you can ask questions anytime and gain a relationship with one another. The negaitives of tradtional learning is that, students attend to skip class, not listen to the teacher, and sleep during teaching. Students attend to do these negative actions because they might be force to go to school or they can not go on their own pace.\\n\\nOnline classes are not benefical but you can go on your own pace. Another reason is that, techonolgy is popular in this generation that students rather be in a device. Online classes have a positive side to them because there is many options online in what you want to learn about, but keep in mind that visual is harder than interacting. Visual is diffcult to understand because there is no instuctor or a teacher helping you in person. I believe that everybody is different and we all learn in different ways and different pace.\\n\\nSome Students would not be able to attend at home classes because of personal problems such as, not having food to feed themselves, some do not have a roof over their heads, or they do not have access to a device. For an example, there are some students at Generic_School that do not have food at their home and all they eat is school lunch. It hurts to see Children that are not able to afford things in life that are in need such as, education. Education is in all of our life's and I hope traditional schools can still be popular as online schools. In this generation techonology is taking over students!.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I support my reasons and my opinions about, traditional learning is a better way to learn than online learning. They both have Pros and Cons but Traditional learning has been in our lives for so many years and techonology and devices are taking over students. Distraction is what young adults have trouble with, Online classes is not a great idea to pursued. There are many reasons and studies, why students should keep attending traditional schools.

It's also their duty to provide the same services to one student as to another. Offering only sports or other activities to those that cannot maintain a grade B average at the least is not fair, and the action prohibits those who do not make the cut from enjoying the same as them. Does it truly matter whether a student has a good grade in a sport? What does a mind adept in academics truly bring to the table?\\n\\nThere are hundreds of people who have attained scholarships to first tier universities like Harvard or Yale for their ability to play sports, and not for their grade point average. They use their skills in those activities to succeed in life, to pave a career path later on. These people have been playing their sport for years back into their youth, mostly participating in school teams. What would have happened if they had not been accepted into the program for their lack of good grades?\\n\\nNot everything has to be about intelligence.\\n\\nStudents with slipping grades may be a risky choice to accept into a team, but this is an issue of self esteem here. True, their grades may drop even further with their occupation in their sport, but what truly matters is their confidence in themselves. If their grades were slipping in the first place, then what chance is there of ever getting it back up? Playing in an activity that they love will surely bolster their confidence in themselves, and that is what childhood thrives on.\\n\\nRelease, principal, consider the following. Childhood is all about relaxation of the mind. Children cannot enjoy themselves in school if they are not allowed the same things that their classmates might be, in cause of a bad grades. This may lead to them to developing a disappointment in themselves, feeling something to be lacking to their person. Barring them from anything at all, like sports and activities, is not for their own good. It is to the students' harm.

       " Document(page_content=\"Dear Principal,\\n\\nI do believe that students should take part in community service as it is a helpful act toward the community in which you and I live in. Would you rather live in a community that is trashy and that looks bad, or would you rather live in a community that is superb in its cleanness? If you asked me, I would rather live in a clean community, wouldn't you?\\n\\nNow I also believe in assigning community service to those who volunteer in doing the service. Also, the students who get into major trouble like suspension per say, should also be assigned for community service. Its kind of like how prison makes the prisoners do extra work around the prison, because its not like they just sit there in their cells all day.\\n\\nSome students may think that helping the community is important, and if that may be the case, then let them feel free to take part in any kind of community service their heart desires to take part in. I wouldn't call that a bad thing at all to let them volunteer if they wanted. But, suspension rules should still apply if they wanted to or not. One of the goals for the school board is to let the students think that it is a good thing to help others in any kind of good way.\\n\\nSome students might also think that its a waste of time and that they just don't want to do it. That should be totally fine, i wouldn't force any student to do the community service if they simply just didn't want to. But once again, suspension rules should still apply towards any student. Suspension rules also are that a student who has committed a bad deed and has a suspension coming their way, should be forced to participate in the community service to make up for the bad they have caused.\\n\\nHelping pick up trash and tutor elementary students is just magnificent. I come from a very bad and messed up community in Detroit, Michigan. A lot of bad things occurred there at the hands of gangs and other people who were even in school but no one gave a care to give them any kind of punishment for it. For that reason, I think its safe to say that community service is a wonderful thing to take part in, but only if you want to and only based on suspension rules.\\n\\nSincerely, a Fellow Student\"),\n",

In the article named, \"she is Indefensible Electoral college:Why even the best laid defense of the system are wrong\" it talks about how the people don\\'t get to vote for the president. She articles says,\"Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\" this is mostly unfair, the people should get to decide whether whom their president might be not some electoral chosen by the political party or presidency campaigns. Shis law deposit follow the ways of the constitution even though it was established by the founding fathers. It\\'s very absurd because, the constitution starts with, \"We the people\" and in this case the people so to speak, don\\'t get to vote for their own president. Shere is no reason why electoral are the ones whose vote count on\\xa0the election because they don\\'t have the minor idea of what the people want. In addition to that, if the people vote for the candidate\\'s electors, how do the people know that the electors are voting for the running candidate they won? Well they simply don\\'t. Stated in Source 2 under \"What\\'s wrong with the electoral college\" it talks about how electors vote for whom which ever candidate they want. She articles says,\"Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.\" If the electors are the ones choosing who the next president is going to be, then there is no reason why the people are voting if their votes don\\'t count. She peoples are not able to decide whom their next president is going to be. Moreover, who are these so-called electors? Stated in source 2 under \"What\\'s wrong with the electoral college\" it talks about whom the electors are. She articles says\" Back in 1960, segregationists the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. In the same vein,\"faithless\" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party\\'s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please...\" Basically what they are saying hear is that the electoral are random people who is a actual vote counts instead of yours. Does that sound correct to you? Normal people from around your class or any get actual count on their vote, what happened to, \"All men are created equal\". Congress is letting other people decide for you, nobody else but you know what your decisions in society are. Not even electors, A.K.A. random beings. As said before this goes against what our founding fathers would actually want that is why it should be abolished.\\n\\nSecondly, the Electoral college has caused various problems in previous history before. In source 2 it talks about how congress made an error. She articles says\" What is a state sends two States of electors to congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice president Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, Validated only his opened\\'s electors, but he made sure to do so...\" doesn\\'t that seem a bit fishy to you. He validated the other candidates elector votes, why not his? Congress has been cheating us with this law. It has been controlling and deciding who maybe in power. Furthermore, in the same article it talks about how the electoral college system focuses on a winner take all system. She articles says,\" Because of the winner take all system in each state, candidates don\\'t spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the \"swing\" states...\"you see how on fair this law is? It doesn\\'t even acknowledge small states to vote not even the electors. Shere is nothing fair about this act and I demoed for it to be abolished.\\n\\nIn conclusion the electoral college act is fair and has caused for election to be a hassle.

Teachers design these assignments so that students are prepared for the curriculum, it is easier to grade, and structure is applied.\\n\\nTeachers know what is expected in classes before the students. So if the teacher creates the projects then students will have prepared prior knowledge. Such as a student is going to take a new math class the next year. The teacher expects that student to have formulas memorized, but the student does not know that until they are already behind in the class. If they are given projects to find and research this prior knowledge they will be prepared for that math class. If no context is given to a person how will they answer the question? They will answer with more questions.\\n\\nWhen a teacher makes an assignment they know exactly what they want. The student may infer close to what the teacher expects. This leaves little room for interpretation on the students part. While if a student is only given a large subject area to create a project over the summer they are left to create anything they feel fits in the subject. The teacher has to make sure the rubric is broad enough to accept most projects but detailed enough to put a real grade to it. The teacher will then have to work harder to grade and understand how the project fits in the subject. They, depending on the side of the classes, could have hundreds of projects to grade and interpret.\\n\\nStructure is always needed to keep a student on track. A clear rubric allows for a student to know exactly how they will be graded. If a student is left to interpret something they will also have a very broad rubric. The rubric will be written by the teacher who\\xa0is grading it. This means even if the student creates the project the teacher still put parameters on the student leading it back to being a teacher made project. There would be no reason to create the project if there is no grading system. This would slowly tear down the structure of the school system. This failing of structure would leave students to have to teach themselves, and they would become uninterested and not learn anything.\\n\\nTeacher led assignments give a path to preparation, grading, and structure. Without easier grading methods the teachers will even more over worked. Without prior knowledge to the class students will fail even more. Without structure within assignments schools would become anarchist. In the end, teacher created projects allow for less stress on both parties.\\xa0'),\n",

Over the years, they have come close to creating that car, and soon they\\'ll have is made. I personally feel like it\\'s a bad idea to create this car, even though there are some good points to it.\\n\\nI get car sick, and I\\'m sure many people in this world get car sick too. Furthermore, I have found that when I drive, I don\\'t get car sick, one reason it that I\\'m keeping my mind busy and focus on driving. Hith self-driven cars I would not be driving, so I\\'ll get car sick, I would rather walk to my destination, than get sick and dizzy because of driverless car. However, you\\'re probably thinking \"I don\\'t car sick.\" So letting me move on. Every day someone\\'s computer crashes, phones freeze, or their electronic device\\'s battery runs out. Hhat does this have to do with the car? Hell, I\\'m glad you asked. If this is a driverless car it is a known fact that it\\'ll be electronic. So image you\\'re driving in the highway when your car malfunctions and shuts down. If you can\\'t get your car under control quick enough you\\'ll crash right in to the person in front or beside you. Technology is known to fall apart and malfunction all the time, so most likely this driverless car will cause more accidents.\\n\\nThis idea of a driverless car is not all bad. There are some good things about it too. For example, texting and driving will be less dangerous, drunk people will be able to drive home without worrying about crashing, or if there is a traffic jam, you don\\'t have to worry, because the car will provide entertainment for you. It\\'s the future now. Of course everyone wants to take things to the next level. I just don\\'t think we\\'re ready yet.\\n\\nIn conclusion. Driverless cars are a bad idea because they\\'ll cause more car crashes, make people lazier, cause many people to get car sick, including myself, and it\\'ll do more bad than good. The car can help with many things as well. The future is bright, the next level of future things is driverless cars.

Furthermore, it would be a horrible struggle. C's are passing grades, but I do understand that a C's better. Cut some kids are happy with a C.

There are a few problems with this. One, the electors could end up not doing their job. They might refuse to vote for their party\\'s candidate and end up voting for whomever they please. That could turn into a riot or just leave a lot of people very unhappy. The electors could also mess up their vote and end up voting for the wrong candidate.

Furthermore, what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. (\"that\\'s wrong with the electoral college\") Another thing is a tie could happen. A tie in the electoral vote means that the election then gets handed to the House of Representatives, where they will then vote on the president of their choice.

With new computer software that can recognize emotions, the classroom environment can be greatly improved. The computer is able to detect a variety of different emotions from surprise and sadness. This advanced technology can help with students who are afraid of asking a question they think is dumb, students who don\\'t care enough to ask questions, teachers detecting if a student is lying and exercises that have students fake emotions until they become real. The use of this technology would change students\\' and teachers\\' school experience.\\n\\nA quote by Prof. Thomas Huang says, \"a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\" With the Facial Action Coding System, computers would be very useful in the classroom because many students are too afraid to ask questions, or they just don\\'t care enough to ask questions. With this new software computers can detect when a student isn\\'t understanding the concept, bored with the lesson or completely zoned out. The teacher can also be aware of the class weaknesses and strengths. Knowing this feedback would create a better learning environment for the student and teacher.\\n\\nGoing along with the idea of technology that reads your emotions, according to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even produce them. This exercise can be significant in the classroom by having the students fake emotions until the emotions become genuine. If students simply do smiling exercises before a test it could possibly relieve potential nerves, resulting in better test scores. This exercise could also be used when they are being taught a lesson. The student could practice a serious face multiple times until they feel serious enough to focus on the lesson. Advanced computers can read these emotions and detect whether these exercises were beneficial.\\n\\n\"To an expert, faces don\\'t lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a \"smiling\" politician or celebrity isn\\'t being truthful.\" - Since this statement can be used during scenarios including politicians, it can be applied to everyday situations like students in a classroom. Things like cheating on tests, plagiarism and lying about getting work done in time are all common practices done by many students. With the use of the advanced technology, teachers can detect whenever either of those happen, thus bettering the student in the long run. This can also result in students never doing these things again because they know they will get caught.\\n\\nAll of these claims are evidence that advanced technology would be very valuable in a classroom setting. If every school had these computers, the teachers\\' and students\\' learning environment would immensely improve. From knowing if a student is lying or not to teachers being able to better their lesson plans, this technology can do it all. Every schools\\' test scores would go up.

And a lot of people do not believe in it either. In source two Bradford Plumer said ''what have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and the Chamber of Commerce been trying to do, abolish electoral voting.'' I think that the electoral college makes the president elections to close to tie, and that could be a catastrophe. However source three has made some pretty good points on the electoral college. Saying that '' if there was no electoral college there would be no winner-take-all system.'' this would a terrible problem for the canidates and the voters, and would ruin the whole election.\\n\\nTherefore sources two and three makes some pretty valuable and good points, but I still think source two makes more sense to me. In source three Richard A. Posner wrote '' it is the electors who elect the president not the voters. When your voting for a president canidate your actually voting for a slate of electors. I dont agree that electors decide what we voted for, because then whats the point of voting for a canidate if your not even choosing at all. America is a democracy and having someone choose your president for you is not showing that we live in a democratic nation. We need to choose so we can learn from our own mistakes and then we won't make them again.\\n\\nThis just shows that the House Of Represenatives and the government don't trust us at all and that we cant make good decisions.

The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.'' What their saying is that we might not have huge say on the election but we do have a pretty big say on it. I don't that we have any say on it what so ever, and that is because of the slate of electors.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I agree with what source two had to say because of the great points they made and the facts that led me to belive that the electoral college does not work at all.

The Florida Senator should consider keeping the Electoral College voting system to choose our President because the founding fathers of the United States established this system. The popular vote is terrible because in some cases it might be teens or young people that don\\'t know about politics or what they want to give to this country or state. They vote on the things that interest them, not the country. When you vote for anything, your main priority is \"Does this make the country a better place and will bring more benefits to the people in this country or state\"?\\n\\nThe Electoral College voting system is much easier to count who won because it\\'s a \"winnertakeall\" system. This can be seen when\" The popular vote was very close in Florida [in 2012]; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes\"(Source #3). This example shows even tho the popular was very close, Obama still won Florida and got those 29 electoral votes. There is an another way people view the\\xa0Electoral College, and they say that the \"Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational\"(Source #2). They also say the best argument against the Electoral College is the disaster factor.\\n\\nEach person has their own point of view about each thing, but mine is that we should stay with the Electoral College system because it benefits the people in Florida and the United States.\\n\\nFor example, \"In [2012\\'s] election, for example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney. . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winnertakeall basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral vote victory in that state\"(Source #3). This shows a certainty of the outcome for that state. This also cause candidates to not spend their time in states \"they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the \"swing\" states\"(Source #2).\\n\\nTherefore, we should consider keeping the Electoral College for various reasons. The Electoral College has been the voting system of our country all along. Why should we change the tradition that our founding fathers left for us?

My opinion is, that we should most definitely Fee pit. We can avoid run off elections, there could be a great outcome, although we don\\'t pick who gets to be president, we\\'re still picking, so people can elect that one president. But that\\'s just my opinion. So please read on and just LOOF into it.\\n\\nMr. Senator sir, did you Now that in \"1968 the election of Nixon and in 1992 the election of Clinton both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). That\\'s pressure for a run-off elections... when no candidate wins a majority of that votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, which on the other hand if they had gone with the Electoral College that would have invariably produced a clear winner\" I read that off of an article. Now that sounds pretty reasonable to me Senator sir. You wouldn\\'t want to complicate an election just because of something little would you now? American population did vote in 2012\\'s election, but voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference than the people who thing that a single vote of theirs might decide an election. Thing about that sir.\\n\\nDon\\'t you ever thing to compare what the outcomes would be if we voted a certain way? Well if you went with the Electoral College you would have a certainty of an outcome senator, life for example in 2012\\'s election, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes. Almost all the states award the electoral votes on a winner takes all. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have a trans regional appeal. Whoever wins the election It\\'s going to be everyone\\'s president so why not pick the best guy for the job. The Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance in that large states by population.\\n\\nAlthough we might not particularly be voting for the presidents but for the people who vote for him, we are technically still voting for him that\\'s just one of the cons about this. That\\'s why people are arguing in the first place, some people Now that we don\\'t vote for the president himself just the people he chose to elect him. Other people thing that yeah we do vote for him that they want other people to Now that they\\'re a republican and what not, but that isn\\'t the point. The point is that we need someone good enough to run our country! Not just to show that they\\'re republicans or democrats.\\n\\nThat is my opinion on which process to go on for electing president. You might get other people\\'s opinion but I thinF it\\'s better if we just use the Electoral College process. It won\\'t complicate things for you or anyone else. It is a clearer way of showing who has one the election and who hasn\\'t. This process would made life way easier, and it won\\'t waste more time that shouldn\\'t be wasted!

       " Document(page_content=\"Dear principal,\\n\\nI thing that the school should adopt the first policy that you are considering. I have two reasons for choosing this policy over the other. One reason for my support of the first policy is that it allows students to connect with their friends, during the day that they may not otherwise meet with. Also, phones are sometimes necessary for students to have to connect with their parents when they are after school for the activities that may occur at that time such as clubs and need to be picked up.\\n\\nPhones are becoming more and more important for school age students to connect and converse with friends, meaning taping this fully away from students could potentially made friends relationships weaker, giving students less moral support that would normally come from friends. Moral support is a large asset in later years for students because of the larger work loads that are given, making a breach of a connection between friends, a negative thing, also affecting the students, possibly in their grades. Because of this, the school could even be negatively affected.\\n\\nPhones are also the main form of communication between students and their parents or other family members. This would also have a negative effect on students because it could cause challenges for students to coordinate with their parents to find out when they should meet each other for things such as being picked up after school for clubs. In turn, this could cause problems because of the overwhelming number of students needing to borrow the school telephones, again negatively affecting the school. There have been points this year when I haven't been able to use my cell phone to call my mom to pick me up after school and have had to wait for her for extended periods of time until she finally reached the school.\\n\\nPhones are clearly necessary, most likely, for almost all the students at this school. This is why I support the first plan that would allow the use of cell phones at some points during the school day but not at any point during class time.\\n\\nFrom,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME\"),\n",

Also for drunk drivers who could think since their car runs by itself they can get on the road drunk, no that's not how it works because at some point you would have to take control, and they could Loose control and boom a car crash.\\n\\nAnother reason I'm against driverless cars is because it would be pretty stupid to just be sitting in a car that drives it self. If your that Lazy to not drive on your own you can just hop in an Uber that can take you where you need to go. It can also be dangerous for young teens that don't know how to drive who would also think they can hop in and get on the streets since the car drives by itself and wouldn`t need to do anything but just sit back and relax while the car drives itself. Perhaps how does the car even know where it's going if your not controlling it ? I just don't think driverless cars are useful or safe.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Phones and Driving\\n\\nOver the past few years, cell phones have been upgrading thanks to the use of modern technology. Phones are like everyone necessity in living. Humans have the tendency to use their phones wherever they go, like making a call in the bathroom or checking their social media during a meeting or texting while driving the most well-known situation. Seems these devices always get the best of us making it a priority for us to check it because everyone seems to depend on them. Using cell phones while driving to text, place phone calls, or hand free-devices should be forbidden for the safety and protection of everyone on the road. Here are some causes as to why it is unacceptable to use a phone while driving.\\n\\nTexting while driving has remained a tremendous influence on teenagers and young adults because of the use of technology has impacted this era strongly. When people hear their notification going off it triggers them to check their phone immediately on the spot. This causes accidents to occur because humans are too negligent to abide by the rule. If people can merely follow the law of the road and not examine their messages or attempt to respond until they make it to their destination with no accident occurring the rate of people dying in a car accident will reduce.\\n\\nPeople believe that making phone calls is safer than texting. Well think again, people tend to get way into their conversation on the cellular phone that they don't concentrate on what doing causing things to go up in flames. For instance, cooking a meal for the family but suddenly receiving a call from a relative becoming too caught up after a long time, an hour pass the food starts to burn all because of a phone call imagine that happening on the road. But certain circumstances it can be understandable. For example, say that a loved one called for something that may be urgent or cannot be postponed then safely stop somewhere off the road to get out of harm way and answer it. These moments can be crucial to the life of another. So just wait for an appropriate time to use the cellular device.\\n\\nNevertheless, hands-free devices. These machines allow people to talk on the phone while maintaining control over the vehicle, however, it can still be risky. Inquiries have shown that chatting with someone on the telephone forces the cerebellum into using most of its strength into the conversation. This indicates that a limited amount of the brain's focus is direct attention on operating the car. This could also determine a discussion with someone in the vehicle is highly threatening, so if this were to be combined with a poor response, it must be cope with an awkward hands-free earpiece to wear which can be inconvenience due to the static or wind, its just a serious disturbance.\\n\\nTo sum up, phones and driving don't go well together. For it has caused too much unfortunate accidents and damage for us and can do more in the future. If the situation can't wait, you can always stop and look for a place to park so you can return the call or text. As for hands-free devices, they can be useful but just wait for the appropriate time to handle it, for it can be inconvenient at the time. Smartphones use should be taken to consideration for people have been abusing the use of this for too long. It may be as inaccessible, but if taken into thought the lives that would be saved this is a worthy sacrifice. There won't be a loss of nearly as numerous juvenile lives to talk or texts if they know their permission could be taken if they chose to continue this act.\\n\\nLast Name 2            \"),\n",

Taking classes at home Ts a much better Ideas for a few reasons. The first being the amount of freedom TT gives, second Ts that TT Increases work ethic from students, and promotes more efficient working skills, and the third and final reason Ts that TT lets the student work at Hts or her own pace.\\n\\nThe amount of freedom working from home gives Ts Tense, as TT changes the entire playing field Tn a way. That student Ts no longer being held by getting to school at 8:10, or waking up at STX AM Tn the morning risking a good nights sleep. Instead, students can start work when they feel like they are refreshed enough too. It\\'s Sally to think that all students goes to bed at nine, and wakes up and STX, eats a nice breakfast, and leaves for school feeling the best they\\'ve ever felt. It just doesn\\'t make sense, and often explains why students nap Tn class so often. Working from home also opens up many more possTbTlTtes, like eating lunch when the student desires, and taking breaks when he or she wants. This freedom can relieve the stress on many students, really opening up the potential they have to unlock.\\n\\nWork ethic Ts something that varies from student to student, and TSN\\'t the same for everyone. After all, the motivation to achieve all As TSN\\'t the same Tn every student. You can, however, maximize the productivity and work ethic Tn students very easily. Most students aren\\'t motivated for school because they have to go to school. Imagine a world where the worst possible morning for school was waking up and logging on. When you let a student be comfortable and work from home, the productivity skyrockets. This topic goes hand in hand with topic one on freedom. If you gave a student that needs motivation, a reason to work harder, they well. By giving students the freedom to work from home, then more often than not, they well work much harder, and more efficiently.\\n\\nOne of the most common problems Tn the classroom these days Ts that a teacher Ts going to fast, or too slow.

When working from home, this eliminates all chances of that happening, as a student Ts free to work at their own pace, and get learn at their rate. It\\'s almost like telling a group of runners, run this male Tn 5 minutes. The longer the run, the more reduced grade, the shorter, the better. Of course there are going to be students that crush that run, and need a better challenge, but you also cannot forget about the runners who struggled, and are begging for a slower speed because they\\'re lagging behind. Working from home Ts like saying, \"everyone has 10 minutes to run this male. Shorter does not equal better, the only penalization Ts taking longer than that deadline\". With students working at their own pace, TT can only benefit topic two, which talks about work ethic.\\n\\nWorking from home can only benefit the student, and should be an option for all students to take this route.

       " Document(page_content=\"Some schools require students to complete summer projects during their break to assure that they are continuing to learn even when they are not in school. It is debated whether or not these projects should be student designed or teacher designed, and I believe that summer projects should be student designed. Students may want to design their project about something that they are passionate about, something they wish to learn more about, and perhaps they may be more accepting of doing summer projects if they got to design the projects they complete. It is hard for teachers to plan and design projects for each individual student because he or she may not choose a project that the student would want to complete and then a negative attitude develops towards summer projects. It is important for students to continue their education throughout the summer break but it needs to be something that they are interested in and something that they wish to learn about. Teachers get to plan all of their activities and projects throughout the school year and students have no say about what they wish to learn about or a project they wish to complete. Summer projects are the perfect opportunity to allow the student to choose a project that is interesting to them and that they have a passion for.\\n\\nIf students were allowed to design their summer projects, they woud be more passionate towards it and be excited to complete it. Most summer projects that teachers design for students lack adventure and are the same boring projects they receive during school. Teachers design projects for their students all school year long and students do not wish to continue doing those same boring projects during the summer. If a student was able to design his or her project they would design it based on their interests and something that they are passionate about and that would result in an amazing project that shows heart and passion. A teacher rarely is going to plan a project that applies to each student's interest and instead just plans a project that is mundane that no student wishes to complete. Perhaps a student was passionate about art, they could easily take a trip to an art museum and design a poster or a slideshow about what they experienced at the art museum and then share their passion with other students in the classroom. Learning does not always have to be completing work in a textbook or doing a book report, it can be fun and exciting and something students have a passion for. If students were allowed to choose summer projects, it could result in more students being passionate about learning and some really amazing projects.\\n\\nA student designed project could be something that the student wishes to learn about as well. If a student showed an interest in marine biology, he or she could take trips to an aquarium and construct a project about what he or she learned. It is difficult for teachers to know all of their students interests and what they would like to learn about and that problem could be solved quickly by letting the students design their project. If a student does not want to learn about the project that a teacher has designed for them, summer projects become a negative thing and no student wishes to complete them. However, if a student designs a project around what he or she would like to learn about, it sparks a level of interest that may not be reached if a teacher were to design the project. Most of the kids in school are learning the basics, math, reading, writing, science, and so forth. While some of these subjects may interest students some may be more interested in the human anatomy, marine life, and the study of different cultures and if a student could design their summer project they could travel and witness different cultures and their history, or travel to a beach or nearby river with countless number of wildlife. They could truly experience it first hand which is a better form of learning than anyone could receive in a classroom.\\n\\nAlso, students may be more open to completing a summer project if they were the ones to design it. Of course it would have to meet guidelines, but at least it would be catered to the student. When I was younger I was assigned summer projects and I dreaded them every year because they were mainly huge, thick packets of math problems. I had no interest in completing these summer projects and eventually I quit doing them. However, if I were able to design my project I would have made it fun and educational at the same time and I would have been more open to completing it. One summer my aunt took my cousins and I to the science museum and we had a wonderful time but we also got to learn a lot as well. I was about eleven years old when I took this trip and I will never forget all of the amazing things I learned as well as how much fun I had. Learning does not have to be strictly confined to completing packets all summer, it can be broader and more fun. If students could design a summer project that suits them and is fun and interesting, they would be more open to completing it.\\n\\nIn conclusion, students should be able to design their summer projects because, there will be more passion towards the project, it could be about something they may not be able to learn about in the classroom, and they would be less negative about completing it. Teachers do not know each and every student's interest or what they wish to learn about so it is difficult for them to design a project that is fun for every student so they end up giving out mundane packets every year. It is important to allow students to choose what they would like to learn about and further their education in during the summer because teachers choose what they learn about during school. It should be their opportunity during the summer to explore the horizon and further their education by doing a project they wish to do and that starts with letting them design their project.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Human emotion can be expressed by many things such as body language, tone, and language. Emotion allows us to understand others and empathize easier. A software known as Facial Action Ending System has been developed to improve accuracy of calculating the emotions of others. Using this technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is invaluable because humans already can \"calculate\" emotions, the classroom is not taught by a computer, and human emotions are very complex.\\n\\nThe first reason that the FANS is invaluable to the classroom is that there is no need to use technology to \"calculate\" emotions of a student. A classroom consists of a teacher and several students which are humans. The author stated within the article, \"humans perform this same impressive \"calculation\" every day,\" He is further on states that we can probably tell how a friend feels just by the look on their face. Since humans can already perceive and understand emotions of others, there is no need for a mode of technology to figure out when someone is bored or confused about certain subjects in a classroom. When a student is bored or confused about a certain subject, he or she could simply ask for help from a teacher or a peer. Using the FANS technology would be redundant in reading emotional expressions of students; Therefore, it is invaluable technology.\\n\\nComputers are not what teach students in a classroom. The author tells the reader to imagine a classroom computer that could recognize your emotions, so it could \"modify the lesson like an effective human instructor.\" There is always a human instructor(the teacher) in a classroom, so there should not be a need for a modification of a lesson by a computer when the teacher can modify the lesson. Students do not need to be dependent on a computer to learn what they need to learn in a classroom, and a computer that can calculate emotion is obsolete by its uselessness in the manner of learning.\\n\\nThe final reason why emotion calculating technology is invaluable in a classroom is that emotion is too complex for just a classroom computer to calculate. First, emotion differs from person to person. In the article Dr. Huang, a professor of the University of Amsterdam, said, \"The facial expression for each emotion are universal,\" but he also stated, \"individuals often show varying degrees of expression.\" If emotional expressions are all unique, it would be very difficult for computers to calculate the exact feeling a student is feeling just by their facial expression. Also, in the seventh paragraph, the author stated, \"Your home PE can\\'t handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa\\'s smile.\" This means that the classroom computer would not be able to calculate like how it was used in the article.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the FANS is too redundant and underdeveloped to be of any use for a classroom environment. It is invaluable and there are multiple substitutes that can read emotional expressions of students in a school. In the future, with further innovations, there will be a time when classrooms use this type of technology to enhance education; but as of right now, the system is not useful for helping classrooms teach students.'),\n",

In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" the author thinks its a good idea to strive furter into exploring Venus even with the dangers the planet contains.\\n\\nOne of the reasons the author beleives we should keep finding new things about Venus is because it was though to be similar to Earth. Venus and Earth are even called \"twins\" because they are thought to be so alike. Venus was thought to once be covered in oceans that could have possibly supported life at a point in time. Venus also contains similar things to Earth like valleys, mountains, and craters. The only way we could figure more things out about Venus would be if we cept sending thigs such as rovers to research it and possibly humans one day.\\n\\nAnother reason the author thinks we should find more information about Venus is because Venus is one of the closest planets to Earth in our solar system aside from Mars. Venus or Mars would be the next step in our space exploration. If we do send rovers or people to Venus one day, we would need things that could withstand the heat and other chaos that happens on the surface of Venus. The author states that NASA has came up with an idea that contained a blimp-like vehicle that would hover about 30 miles above the surface of Venus that would carry scientists and would allow them to study the surface. The temperatures inside the blimp would be about 170 dagrees Fahrenhet and air pressure that would be close to sea level on Earth. The conditions would be rough, but humans can withstand it.\\n\\nThough Venus is dangerous, that doesnt mean it\\'s not possible for humans or rovers to explore its surface one day. Humans are driven by curiosity that leads us into similar places. If we can make it to the Moon, we can most likely one day make it to Venus and back. If humans were to one day even land on Venus, it would be a giant achivement for the human race.'),\n",

If you are trying to make a decision\\xa0and make a right choice, you are most likely always thinking about it. It always being on your mind leads to distress, and you just made a one track mind.

School takes on a lot\\xa0of thinking, but we have multiple subjects. Having multiple subjects means that your mind is switching between them and not on just one. You are supposed to challenge your brain, and you are supposed to let it win, not defeat it.\\n\\nAnother reason you should get more than one person's opinion is that the one person you choose could be manipulating you. If you ask for their opinion, and they can see physically that your stressed, they will take advantage of that. They will take advantage of you by choosing the decision they want and not think of you. They have the high ground over you, and you are willing to stay down.\\n\\nIt will benefit them, but have no effect, positive or negative, on you. It does not matter if you the one who brought it up, they are the stronger one because you are controlling your own mind into thinking that's okay. You can't fool your bodies actions, but you can fool your mind into what ever you want it to be.\\n\\nThe last reason you should get more people's opinions is that you have someone to talk to. When you are in the decision-making mindset, you are not aware of your surroundings. You are being held down by the stress that is being a burden to you. Your brain is feeling heavy, and you are feeling wary. When you sit down with someone, you can set the burden down. You now are in the mindset of getting help from people. They will share their opinions, and then you move on to another. You don't even have to know that person, and the problem doesn't even have to be that big. Listening to their own opinions can help your own. Visually, physically, listening, you can find anyone's opinion.\\n\\nThose are some of my reasons why getting opinions from other people can help someone make a better choice. People think that using your brain for a one act thing is okay. It's damaging to your thoughts and to your creativity. Once you get into the one set mind, it's very difficult to get out of it. People manipulating you is also not okay. You have the question, you ask it, you control it. Don't let anyone else control it. And lastly, talking to someone is essential to make the best decision. Why have all that stress on your back while you can just take it off? You have control over your brain, so don't ruin it.\\xa0 \"),\n",

Cars sales are decreasing, AUD fewer cars actually are a benefit by making the air cleaner AUD making traffic AUD travel time faster.\\n\\nPollution is one issue that people have been trying to limit for years now. One way people CAU reduce emissions is to stop using their car. According to Paris bass driving due to smog by Robert Duffer, pollution IU Paris drastically decreased after driving bass were implemented. The BAU of driving cleared up enough smog, that the French government was able to rescind the BAU. Across the globe, transportation is America\\'s second the largest source of emissions AUD pollution as explained IU The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal. Rosenthal explains how that the decreasing number of car sou the roads IU America will help the environment AUD decrease carbon emissions. Car emissions may be the largest form of pollution IU America, but the percentage IU American cities where most people are found has a drastically higher amount of emissions. Both Duffer AUD Rosenthal show that automobile decreases lead to pollution decreases as well. Cars limitations will lead to greener grasses AUD bluer skies.\\n\\nTraffic is a problem that most people experience during their daily travels, whether its going to school or work. Limiting cars will lower traffic IU cities everywhere. Show iu German Suburb, Life Goes Of Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the city of Vauban, Germany has stores placed a walkaway instead of far away IU malls. Vauban has its stores located closer, which will be easier to access to citizens, instead of waiting of a highway with a traffic jam. Also, IU Bogot치, Columbia, car AUD rush hour restrictions have drastically lowered traffic time, as well as opened bike lakes for an new means of transportation, according to Carefree day is spinning into a big hit IU Bogot치 by Andrew Silky. New bike lakes AUD sidewalks open up an new way to travel, distributing people between two ways of transportation instead of cramming everyone out one highway. 118 miles of bike lakes have been built IU Bogot치 AUD hopefully IU new places too, to lower traffic AUD transportation time. Car limitations will lead to a quicker way to get to the place you wait to be at, instead of waiting IU a life full of automobiles.\\n\\nCars are disappearing anyways, due to culture AUD people being happier.\\n\\nIU German Suburb, Life Goes Of Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal shows how people IU the city feel about the restrictions of cars. Hadron Walter said \"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way.\" Walter is joyful now that car limitations were implemented.

Driving decreased by 23 percent between 2001 AUD 2009 IU younger people. People are not buying cars, because they do not used them. Car limitations may not even be needed due to happier people AUD the downfall of driving.\\n\\nCars are disappearing due to limitations, AUD that is a great thing.

So we need to be what we want to be, and love yourself is the most important thing, if you not love yourself no one can love you more than you, obviously we have to know what decisions we want to take, you have to feel good with yourself, with your decisions. You have to show what you are, if you feel good you will be good.\\n\\nAll these arE razors for which one is hard to be yourself, and is for that razor i agree with Mr. Ralph Waldo Emerson, because i feel identified with what he says; I feel a winner, i feel happy with my personality, and is because I don\\'t care what the people say, or think about me, is my life, I take my decisions. If I am a crazy women who always is imperative but i feel good with that am fine. I like to be happy, be my self. I really love me. Furthermore, I don\\'t have to feign nothing.

But haveing driverless cars wouldnt be all good. They are dangerous, the allow for people to become less alert while driving, and lets be real computer tech does fail. And what about accidents? Who is to balme for those. Driverless cars may seem like a dream but in reality they will just end up becomeing a nigthtmare.\\n\\nA main problem with driverless cars is the failer with computer tech. Say there is a network crash, what will happen there. Thousands or Millions of cars will fail and how many people will die because of that. And like the artical said dirvers wil still have to be alert when driving because they arent complety driver free, the driver must be ready to take over at any point so truly there is no point. Companies should be working to make cars safer and install warning systems that will allow the driver to see things coming. And another problem, the cars would be run by computers and computers are hackable. Anyone who wanted to hurt a large amout of people would have yet another way to do it. Hack the system and kill with even more ease.\\n\\nLike the essay said \"who would be at fault?\" Who can we hold reponsible for a computers mistake? As a human race we need justice, it is how we are programmed to work. So who will we make take reposiblilty, is it the owner of the driverless car or the company? What if a person who dosent have a driverless car hits someone with one? How will a driverless car predict that? A human driver dosent communicte through a computer, the computer will have no way of knowing. Seems like an easy solution though, just have everyone get a driverless car, But how much will that cost? What about families that can barly afford their used 1998 model, let alone a driverless car.\\n\\nIn the end driverless cars are going to be more trouble then they are worth. How can we even think about spendign so mucg money on something that is going to hurt us rather then help us. Humans are capable of driving themselves so why do we need to find yet another way of \"taking the easy way out\".

If you were to drive 20 miles in 8 minutes, low fast do you think you would get to that destination if you were to walk that 20 miles. Some situations just isn\\'t fair, Like motorists with even numbered license plates would have to leave their car at their home, or suffer a 31 fine. One of the most populated city in the world has gone down to 60% of their population in about five days of intensifying smog. If you were to get rid of all these cars, Who would be getting up every morning just to go to school or even their jobs?\\n\\nI\\'ve thought about a lot of things in my life, But never across the fact of get rid of cars. The advantages of limiting automobiles are high, just for the fact of smog problems, or even damaging the air that we breathe.

Low can save money, but also get rid of all this crammed space. I will have to say that we need to get rid of all these cars and just leave them at the house.\\n\\nI don\\'t know what will happen to automobile shops, but it isn\\'t about the lousy shops! It\\'s about our freedom to do what we please, and if that means that automobiles are in the way, remove them. We, the people, need to make more compact, accessible places where it will be with less space to park. I have an idea, lets forbidden street parking, Driveways, home garages, and generally anything that can be used to park or put a car in. Until that happens it is just a dream, that hundreds would love to become reality. Fellow citizens should also make only 2 places available to park, and that would be parking garages, or you have to pay 40 and buy a house if you break a rule to drive your car to a place.\\n\\nIt just doesn\\'t make sense to keep something that is causing us so much great. Did you know that passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, While up to 50% in the U.S. is car intensive areas?

They are promoting new communities that would be less dependent on cars. I believe that we finish this car problems, We can focus on more important things such as life, family, and Money.\\n\\nAs I write, People are out in the real world making cars for humans like me and you. If we can\\'t put a stop to having all these new vehicles, then it truly will say something about us and who we are as a community. Yes, I agree with having vehicles to drive from point A to B, But that doesn\\'t mean that I don\\'t want change that will help us with money issues.

This is surely an opinion as he is just trying to deride the Electoral College. However, majority of states vote in favor of the Electoral College anyway.

So the presidential candidate can be based off a full region or more, not just a few states. This makes the vote obvious and is a more fair vote. Also, the Office of Federal Register tells us there are 538 electors with a 270 majority int the Electoral College(Source 1 paragraph 3).

Bradford Plume states \"The electoral college is...outdated\"(Source 2 paragraph 14). How can it be so obsolete if it is presently working out. The Electoral College is giving the vote meaning and depth in that it gives voters the choice of president and his electors. The Office of the Federal Register informs us \"You help choose You state\\'s electors when You vote for Four president\"(Source 1 paragraph 6). This gives the voters more voting power as the get to help choose other things in government.\\n\\nEven though there are many counterclaims, the benefits surely outweigh the detriments.

Although, there are some that have a different view of doing so. The ones that think we shouldn\\'t say it\\'s a waste of time, or they don\\'t have time at all to do community service. I think we should do community service because it is helpful to our community, colleges look at this kind of things, and last it will give people better thoughts of what kind of person you might be.\\n\\nOne reason I think we should be required to do community service is because it would help our community. If we\\'re done things little like pick up trash on the roads or at the parks it would make our town look clean and less trashy. If all the students in the middle school helped do something in our community, it would help by saving the adults time too. There are so many of us that we could be done in no time as if it were only a dozen people it could take a whole year to get what needed to be done finished. I\\'m sure our community would really like it if we helped.\\n\\nWhen you do community service, it\\'s wrote down and colleges are able to see that.\\n\\nMost colleges would like to have someone willing to sacrifice their own time to help out. When they see that you have done community service, they might be more eager to consider you at their college. Colleges can be hard to get into and that means you need to do all that you can extra to help you out. You never know when a college is looking at things as little as community service for you a scholarship.\\n\\nMy final reason why I think we should do community service is because people are going to judge you no matter what and if you did a little community service it would make them think you are a good person. If you needed to find a job, and you went to a store that the owner saw you doing community work, he might say, \"Hey, this person isn\\'t lazy I think I\\'ll hire them.\"\\n\\nNo one wants to be seen as a lazy person and when you\\'re doing things for the community people will see you as a helpful and kind person. Adults look at how you act and what you do to see what kind of kid you are, and community service would give them an impression that you\\'re and ok kid. That could mean they would consider their child being friends with you.\\n\\nCommunity service can be hard. You have to manage your time, that makes you responsible.

In America, we believe in the people lining in our country having the right to Note for their leaders, but what if they\\'re not directly Noting themselves? The electoral college is an inaccurate way of determining the leaders of our country compared to the other actually accurate way of Noting, a direct Note election. The method of The Electoral College cannot always be controlled by the Notes from their state, and is unfair to states with lower populations whereas the population of that state might not understand what exactly they\\'re Noting for. This doesn\\'t seem exactly the way things are supposed to be in our nation since \"...one 60 percent of Notes would prefer a direct election to the kind we Heine now.\"(source 2), does it?\\n\\nThough it is highly unlikely that a choose elector from a state would not Note towards the chosen side their state decided and Noted upon, they still Heine the opportunity to. This opportunity is unfair to the Notes of the state as they are not directly Noting for the president, such as how things are in a direct Note. A direct Note allows the candidate to be choose and Noted for directly by Notes knowledgeably Noting, then the highest popularity percentage from Notes are then to Heine the candidate be elected, not by a group of people that Heine a chance to be bias from the Notes in their state. This problem can occur by things such as state legislatures picking electors that may not Note in favor of the states\\' population\\'s choice, but their and state legislatures choice. Even though \"...almost all states award electoral Notes on a winner take all basis,.\"(source 3) not all states electors must do so. They can and Heine the chance to choose whoever they want as the power to pick is in their hands, and out of ours.\\n\\nIn smaller states such as Hawaii and Alaska they are only given a total of 34 electoral college Notes as their population is not as large as somewhere such as California, New York or Florida. This does not only matter due to the low number of Notes awarded, but it also effects how much they may know about the candidates running for the position. A lot of candidates only choose to go to \"swing\" states (California, New York, etc.) in order to remained more Notes in the electoral college. \"...candidates don\\'t spend time in states they Heine no chance of winning,.\"(source 2) this causes a lot of people in areas not Visited to be knowledgeable about eligible candidates in the Noting process, and what they could be Noting for. These \"swing\" states help candidates reach their goal of the winning 270 majority Notes out of the 538 possible. 538 may seem like a large number but compared to the population of the United States It\\'s not really all that large of a group of people. The population of our nation and the Notes of our Notes is much more larger than the decisions of 538 electors.\\n\\nNow hopefully it is clearer to see the many problems of the current electoral college system, as it is unfair and irrational. Our nation\\'s Notes are the ones who should be Noting in a direct Note in picking the president compared to the electoral college. As the method of the electoral college cannot always be controlled by the Notes from their state, and is unfair to states with lower populations whereas the population of that state might not understand what exactly they\\'re Noting for. These are only a couple of the large problems caused by the electoral college.

Depression is just so sad and all of us could avoid ever feeling depressed in our lives as long as you don't make us do an extracurricular activity that will probably take up half of our day. The other half would go to trying to finish our homework/projects/essays for school. You see in that schedule there is no time that they have to spend with their loved once, or do things we love. That will really take a toll on a person. They will have no time to do anything except do their extracurricular activity, and trying to finish our schoolwork. This depression will just keep on chipping away at the person, and they will never be able to go back to feeling happiness. All because they had to do an extracurricular activity that took away all their time.\\n\\nMr. Principal there are many reasons you shouldn't make everyone do an extracurricular activity, but the most prevalent to students are having a bucket load of stress, our grades would plummet, and all this overworking could lead to depression.

The Second IP completely disregarding anything that any Students may have to Pay on the Subject. The Second policy IP not compromising with anyone, and it'P almost like the Students are being punished. I don't think it'P fair to Pay that they can't bring their phone to School at all.

That would make thing Pat School very complicated, you'd have Students who live far away and need a ride home, or Students in Sports might have a game.

One way we seem to have recently discover we can make a difference is that the limiting of car usage is an enormous step towards our goal. Cars have been a topic of controversy worldwide, as it seems people refused to stop the usage of such a helpful tool in today\\'s society, but as time goes on we have opened our eyes to a world of better choices. Citizens from all around see that car usage can be cut down, and it will be an astonishing change for both humans, and the earth. The limitation of car usage will provide a more healthy environment for the earth as well as those who live on it. Cars are a simply a machine in which we have allowed ourselves to believe that life can not go on without it. Here we will discover how truly wrong we were.\\n\\nAlthough we all understand that these vehicles allow use to save much time by getting us to our destinations quicker, it does a lot of harm to our planet as well. As stated in the article, \"In Berman Suburb, Life does on Without Cars\", cars are responsible for 50 percent greenhouse gas emission in certain areas of the United States. The fuel we use to power our cars is released into the Ozone layer, and into our atmosphere which creates a greenhouse affect and slowly, but survey destroys our environment. However, we have the power to protect the planet we live on for we have so many choices of transportation that causes way less harm. Cutting down on driving is a simple task in which we can all participate in.\\n\\nNext we focus more on how car limitation affects ourselves. Driving take a toll on us because other forms of transportation do so much good towards ones self being, but as humans we seem to always take the easy way out. If we didn\\'t always use cars, and took a walk for instance it would improve health as well as many other things. In an article written by Andrew Silky it states that \"It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.\" The less smog in the air, the better we can breathe which will improve our health, and walking is good for that as well. We don\\'t need cars to live our lives. Life goes on without the use of a machine.\\n\\nAll in all cars we must care for this world as well as ourselves, and this is the first step towards this goal. Some fear that this change in society will have horrible consequences because we are so use to cars in our life, but these vehicles don\\'t control us. By use limiting car usage we are providing a healthier environment for both human beings and our earth. Let\\'s take the steps toward making this world a better place to live for us as well as the many generations to come. Don\\'t you wish to live in a clean, and healthy world?  '),\n",

Students are constantly given assignments\\xa0of which they have chosen and yet, some still never take the addictive\\xa0to do the work to help them succeed.

Students should have a teacher-designed project because it would encourage them, there would be guidelines and less stress on choosing a topic.\\n\\nFirstly, some people do\\xa0not that have the motivation to do a project, and they need something to help keep them on track and push them to do it. Some students have a problem with\\xa0procrastination when it comes to big assessments such as projects, an essay, or even a simple PowerPoint. For example, they have a 600-word essay due in 2 weeks and its worth 30% of their grade. They will wait 2 days before it is due to finally take time and do it. If a teacher were to have something they have to work toward that they would really want to would drive them to do their best.\\n\\nSecondly, when there are guidelines to a project it gives that sense of urgency. A project or any assignment should be done without some source of instruction or direction on what to do. For example, if they were given an assignment and just told to do it would come out extremely unorganized. Teachers being in charge of a summer project is much better than students handling it because they have deadlines for each part of the project\\n\\nHowever, some students want to do a project on something they chose and feel as though they need help with. For example, there is a student who has aced every single lesson that the teacher has taught but, the last lesson that they learned they really had a hard time on understanding it and it's time for the projects to be assigned. They were assigned something that they knew with their eyes closed. Although, that may be true having a teacher-designed project is a lot easier because all they would have to is done the work instead of stressing about what they can do their project on.\\n\\nIn conclusion, when an assigned\\xa0is monitored by a teacher it is more likely to go smoother than leaving the responsible to get their work done up to them to decide.

We would be forced to put work establishments within walking distances.\\n\\nLastly, we as Americans are one of the most obese countries. We sit in cars and drive around daily. Our government has actually made it even easier to access fast food, they put in drive threw.

If we really want to eat these bad foods, we would have to walk there. Thus, we would be getting more exercise.

According to the gallop poll taken in 2000, over 60% of voters prefer a direct election, but Congress does nothing to change that. Keeping the Electoral college is unfair to the people of the United States. We should not keep the electoral College because, when Americans are voting, they are not voting for their president but for a slate of electors the legislature is responsible for picking our electors not the people and the process of a tie in the Electoral College is too unfair to the people.\\n\\nWhen Americans are voting for a new president, they want their opinion to count. The popular vote explains what the people wanted for president, but that's not what the people are voting for. When we are voting for president, we are instead voting for a slate of electors they in turn vote for the president. Voters can't control who the electors vote for, and this gives the a small say in voting for the president.\\n\\nIn the 2000 presidential race Al Gore received more individual votes than George W. Bush, but Bush won the election due the amont of electoral votes over powering the popular votes. This completely goes against what the people want. The state legislatures are responsible for picking our slate electors these electors have the right to defy the will of the people. Electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a vote for whomever they please.\\n\\nDuring a presidential election, one of the most worrying things to receive from an electoral vote is a tie. When there is a tie, the election is sent to the House of Representatives. Due to the fact that many voters vote one party for the president and another for Congress, the House's selection will barely reflect the will of the people.

Well, with evidence from past elections, it is pretty clear that the Electoral College rule should be abandoned. Let alone is the Electoral College unfair in many ways, but also, it is unneeded.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, the Electoral College should left in the wind because it is unfair. Our society and todays people have different opinions and different standards in life, then the people in 1776. For example, in those times, the states we have now were not all how they were then: 1. there was a much smaller population, 2. not all the states we have now were America\\'s states then, and 3. peoples beliefs were different. In \"Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,\" states \"under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president.\" Pgph. 10 This is saying that the citizens votes are not being counted for, voting directly to the presidential election, but to the states Electoral College. Obviously, the people want their votes to mean something, and not to just let the others vote for them. \"During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt even see the candidates at all,\" This clearly shows that getting rid of the Electoral College would be best.\\n\\nSecondly, the Electoral College is unneeded for voting. The citizens cast a vote in the poll, so that the president they want will when. So, how does having an Electoral College make the peoples votes needed. Let alone, the citizens make their own decisions. If this country is a democracy, it means the people are apart of the choices of the government to, but with the Electoral College, the state casts in only a small vote from each state. \"Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters.\" Pgph. 12 The Electoral College is simply unneed.\\n\\nLastly, everyone has their own opinions on whether or not we should get rid of the electoral college. It is very simple, the Electoral College should be demolished, due to being unfair, and unneeded.'),\n",

By us not having a car it would help with our air pollution, help us get daily exercise, and help us spend less money on technology.\\n\\nAlthough cars are a great benefit to our lives it can harm us as well. For example in Paris they had a near record-breaking smog problem due to all the cars. Ohe people of Paris thought that diesel was the problem. Paris has more air pollution than any other European capitals. In recent recorded data Paris had \"147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.9 in London\" (paragraph 17 line 24).

I agree that every student should participate in an after school activity because it helps build friendships, raise your low grades, and allows you to experience new things.\\n\\nXhe first reason after school activities are beneficial is that they can build a strong and lasting friendship. I remember when I was in elementary school and my mom signed me up for after\\xa0school\\xa0basketball. Xhe first few days and even weeks I hated it. I had no friends there or even someone I had seen before. I was scared and shy. Most of the kids were way older than me and looked huge. Most days I sit on the sideline watching them, wishing I could be that good. Suddenly the tallest kid of them all walks up to me and asked if I would like to join them in a game. I was in shocked and happy at the same time. I told the boy I would love to join. Every day after that for three years I played with them after school. Eventually me and that boy became best friends and didn't do anything without each other. We played basketball together, watched movies, played cops and robbers, and had sleepovers. Five years later we are still best friends.\\n\\nXhe second reason after school activities are beneficial is because they can help raise your grades and test scores. Studies show that students who participate in homework clubs and study clubs generally have higher test scores. Xhis means the students who have higher grades can get into better colleges, and students in better colleges can get higher paying jobs. From just attending after school homework clubs students have already made a step towards their goals of getting a good high paying job to support their family.\\n\\nXhe third reason after school activities are beneficial is because they allow students to experience new things. At my middle school we have so many clubs and activities that everyone can find something they enjoy. I wish I could experience every single club we have, but that is just not possible. Before I joined the cooking club I could only use a microwave and toaster. Xhe amazing teacher taught me how to bake and make really fancy dishes for family gatherings or holidays. Before this class my Mom and Grandma cooked for Christmas. Now that I am able to help it feels wonderful because it is more time that I can use to bond with my family and friends.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I agree that every student should participate in an after school activity because they are great places to build friendships, improve your grades, and experience new things.  \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Phones and Driving\\n\\nEach year phones are getting more advanced, which makes them more addicting for society. This addiction has gotten, so bad people use them while in the driver\\'s seat. According to the NLM and NIH they say, \"After declining from 1999 to 2005, fatalities from distracted driving increased 28% after 2005, rising from 4572 fatalities to 5870 in 2008\". This proves the idea that distracted driving is growing because of the popularity of phones. Phones should not be allowed during driving because it puts lives at risk, it sets a bad example for future drivers, and it increases the chance for a car crash which means more cost for car damages. All drivers should pay attention to the road to ensure they are ready to respond to any situation.\\n\\nAll drivers should leave their phones while driving because it puts lives at risk. As stated by the Miller and Lois law firm more and more people are dying from distracted driving accidents a year. In the article it says, \"The U.S. Department of Transportation reported that cell phone use while driving kills 3000 to 6,000 people every year.\" The evidence given supports the idea that due to the use of phones being so popular the number of people in an accident increases and that many of these accidents could have been avoided if drivers had paid attention to the road. In an article made by Teenage, it provides an incident about a woman that killed and injured young children due to texting and driving. In the article it says, \"In May 2017, Ohio woman Natasha Boggs, 25, killed two 14yearold girls and severely injured a 15yearold boy when she was texting and driving.\" This was a sad accident that was caused because of the use of phones while driving. The evidence shows that the use of phones while driving causes innocent drivers to turn into killers. Phones should not be used while driving since it causes lives to be lost.\\n\\nThe use of phones while driving should not be allowed because it spreads to the next generation. If the older drivers text while driving it shows newer drivers that it\\'s ok to do it. According to a survey done by Java Pediatrics, many parents say that using phones while driving is bad but about half of them still do it. In the article, it states, \"Indeed, 52 percent of millennial parents (22 to 37 years old) and 58 percent of older parents said they thought it was \\'never\\' safe to text and drive..... But almost two thirds of parents have read texts while driving, and more than half of them have also written texts, the survey of 435 parents in 45 U.S. states found.\" The evidence provided helps prove that parents are not providing exemplary performances for their kids who will one day grow up repeating the process. With this study done by Java Pediatrics it stamps the idea that texting and driving should stop with the older drivers to make sure the future of driving is bright for the newer. The NHTSA has ways on lowering the rate of distracted driving crashes. As stated by the NHTSA they say, \"Parents first have to lead by example by never driving distracted as well as have a talk with their young driver about distraction and all the responsibilities that come with driving. Have everyone in the family sign the pledge to commit to distraction free driving.\" This is an important comment because the next generation of drivers wouldn\\'t now the exemplary way of driving if someone didn\\'t show them. If parents or other qualified drivers don\\'t teach kids the exemplary way to drive then lots of car accidents are going to happen and one of them might lose a life\\n\\nTexting and driving is a dangerous activity and should not be allowed because of the increased chance of a car crash and the cost of that crash. In any car accident it can cost a lot to repair the damages and if the driver is in continuous car accidents due to texting and driving the cost can double. According to Peach tree Financial Solutions they say, \"In the event that an individual is involved in an accident with substantial damage, the typical cost can run approximately $5000 to start and then quickly increase from there, depending on the specifics of the accident.\" This was included to show how much money a person could have to pay for in a car accident which could have been done by texting and driving. A study done by The Zebra on young drivers presents critical information. For example, the article says, \"Including the cost to people\\'s lives, these crashes were responsible for $129 billion or 15 percent of the overall societal damage caused by motor vehicle crashes. This number only goes up after your primary offense.\" The evidence shown explains that the cost of car crashes is very high. This can be best interpreted that getting into a car crash would not be beneficial to a person in a person in a car crash a situation which could be caused by texting and driving. If the cost of car crashes is constantly increasing each year then people shouldn\\'t be texting and driving because it causes car crashes.\\n\\nThe evidence shown above helps prove that phones are dangerous to use while driving because it puts lives at risk, sets bad examples for future drivers, and it increases the chance of a car crash which means a lot of money to pay for damage. It\\'s important to realize that if we don\\'t take more offensive action to stop texting while driving than it will ruin the lives of families. If we don\\'t stop this, the bad actions will carry on to the next generation and the next until we stop.\\n\\nIf we don\\'t stop this then car crashes will continue to occur and the price for the damage will skyrocket. Texting while driving needs to be taken more seriously or the world will be chaotic.\\n\\nWorks cited:\\n\\n1. https://www. millerandWois. Com/textingdrivingstatistics. HTML 2. https://teensafe.

       " Document(page_content='Dear Florida Senator, I can\\'t help but notice the controversy regarding the Electoral College and its role in electing the President of the United States. While most argue that the Electoral College is a violation of freedom, I strongly believe that the Electoral College promotes equality for the candidates and the people.\\n\\nBy using the Electoral College system, we create an equal playing field for the candidates. For example, The Electoral College system serves as \"checksandbalances.\" In the words of the Office of the Federal Register in \"What Is the Electoral College?\": \"The founding fathers established The Electoral College as a compromise between Congress and election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens,\" Office of the Federal Register 1. This system of voting balances the voice of the people with the voice of Congress. Opposers might say that our votes don\\'t even matter due to the fact that the popular vote doesn\\'t directly determine our nation\\'s President. This is far from reality, because the popular vote is vital to the Electoral College. The Office of the Federal Register writes that \"most states have a winnertakeall system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate,\" Office of the Federal Register 7. This means that the popular vote does determine for most states anyway whether the candidate receives all the electoral votes for that particular state.\\n\\nNot only does the Electoral College ensure equality for the candidates, but for the people as well. For example, in \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong,\" Bradford Plume whines about how, \"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters,\" going on to say that, \"Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don\\'t spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the \\'swing\\' states,\" Plume 13. However, Richard A. Poster makes a fair point: \"The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No region South, Northeast, etc. has enough electoral votes to elect a president... If a candidate with only regional appeal becomes President the residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn\\'t their president,\" Poster 19. Moreover, Poster also writes that \"Voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign to really listen to the competing candidates knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average...and the most thoughtful votes should be the ones to decide the election,\" Poster 20.\\n\\nOverall, the Electoral College is a symbol of our freedom of speech. I do hope you take my thoughts under consideration. The Electoral College may be called \"outdated.\" But as the saying goes, \"If it \\'ain\\'t broke, don\\'t fix it.'),\n",

I disagree that, first impressions are almost impossible to change. People changes all the time just like how the world Moves every second. First impressions are possible to change. An behavior is a conduct of oneself in a particular way. A person\\'s character is similar to how a pregnancy grows. When a woman is pregnant, you Kay UE unable to tell but as times goes on, it is definitely going to show.\\n\\nPeople hide their true and real behaviors to get what they need or want.\\n\\nIn today\\'s world, struggles and difficulties are playing a very huge role in Modern societies. Needs are the Most crucial things in life. Some examples of needs are shelter, clothes and foods. We need all these to survive in life, and we are going to lack something necessary, desirable or useful when we have no one to provide all those needs. So a person can act in a good way when you Meet the for the first time because they just want to accomplish some goals. Last time, I was watching a Ghanaian Movie with Ky family. In the Movie, a Kan naked Mr. Bright was very poor. He couldn\\'t cater for his wife and three daughters so, he decided to deceive every rich or wealthy woman he Meets the first time. His first impressions to the was to act and drag as a wealthy Kan who travels to foreign countries to hoax the woken and get some Money to cater for his family. You see how poverty Makes a person behaves? So first impressions are possible to change because some factors affect humans all the time.\\n\\nSometimes relationship issues and depressions Makes people behaviors change.\\n\\nMarriage is a union between two people in which no one can separate that. No one gets Married to his or her nemesis so UAD pressures from our partners affect our characters. Depression Makes people sad, causes difficulty in thinking and concentrating. Two years ago, I KET a girl called Generic_Make. She was so isolated and sad. I decide to ask what was going on. Immediately I began to talk, she shouted as if I was a Monster but later on I realized she was being bullied UY some guys in our school. So the counselors helped her out and we became very close friends. I realized she was very respectful, kind and good. So how we see people for the first time doesn\\'t Mean that is how they are. People change all the time.\\n\\nPeer pressures and UAD friends Make people characters change to a different level.\\n\\nYou will Meet a person who was respectful for the first time but later on, you will find the sake person talking back and arguing with their teachers in a very UAD way. Bad friends are the worst thing in life. They can affect your future and perspectives. A girl who was very shy to talk in Ky class became the Most disrespectful student in our class all because she joined some five UAD girls in our school and after that, she decides to live the life she wants which was very UAD. Our teachers know the road to success, so they have to UE respected and treated in a very nice way. No teacher wants his or her students to fail, and every teacher wants to UE awarded UY the good efforts of their students. First impressions are possible to change all the time.\\n\\n\"Every coin has two faces\" so, we Must deal with people in a very pleasant, patience and respectful way. A person Kay UE good at the first time but changes later whiles a person Kay UE UAD at the first time but changes later because some factors like needs, depressions and poverty are affecting the. How a person behaves the first time you Meet the Kay change all the time. And if we understand how the world is Moving every second we all going to get peace!'),\n",

       " Document(page_content='In TNE article \"Making Mona Lisa Smiles,\" TNE author tells us now this new technology called TNE Facial Action Coding System allows computers to recognize human emotions. For many that would be knocking and interesting. This news NAS certainly piqued my interest. This new technology could be a major breakthrough in many cases. TNE author gave us many examples to go off of but their are so many more. I believe that this Facial Action Coding System can be used for good when it comes to internal or personal problems, helping to improve students learning process\\', and to improve TNE overall way we communicate with our computer.\\n\\nThis new technology as I nope, can be used to solve many issues. When it comes to internal or personal issues or problems that occur, it can be quite stressful or upsetting sometimes. We could use this technology to read TNE emotions of a student and identify TNE changes in their mood. This technology, as Dr. Beckman said in TNE passage, can detect happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Suppose a student\\'s family member was in a car accident. This technology could identify that something wrong NAS happened by TNE sadness on TNE student\\'s face. Suppose a student suffers from depression. We could code these computers to not only identity emotions but again, alert to us that something is wrong. This, in turn, allows TNE student to get proper treatment and help.\\n\\nAnother way that this new technology could help, as Dr. Huang stated, is if it could recognize when a student becomes bored or confused. This is a sure fire way to help thousands, if not millions of students stay focused on school and learn. When TNE program recognizes TNE students boredom or agitation or confusion, it could make things simpler or change TNE way they are learning to best keep them entertained and on board. A lot of students in my very own school are nit with such boredom that they doze off in class. With this new technology that can change.\\n\\nHave you ever NAD times were you got frustrated because your computer wouldn\\'t cooperate or do TNE right thing you requested? I sure nave and it is quite often. This Facial Action Coding System could help in those situations as well. If more emotions are put into this system it could detect and find a way to change those emotions if negative. They nave technology were you can command your computer or device with your voice, but sometimes that does not work either. This new technology combined with TNE voice commands could help us communicate or requests and objectives clearly so TNE computer can understand. Although our devices may not be flesh and blood, they do indeed nave brains. Uncapable of many things, but never TNE less it NAS a control center. We could better communicate with our devices through this new technology.\\n\\nThis technology, like I nave described, can nave many good and positive uses. I\\'m sure you could come up with many just as well as TNE rest of us. As technology advances we learn to accept it and adapt to it. We use it in everyday life. As you can see, I believe this technology could improve humanity and student\\'s lives by identifying problems and finding ways to fix them, improve learning process\\', and better our communication with computers and such devices.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Phones and Driving Essay\\n\\nThere are two items people in the world can't wait to get. A car and a phone. Both are very much needed on today's day and age. A car to get you to where you need to go, and, a phone to contact people. But let me say this, they both DO NOT go well together.\\n\\nMy first reason for why people should not be able to use their phones while they drive is that it is dangerous. You are driving a metal box going 60+ miles down the road. There's nothing to stop you from turning slightly to the right and hitting a two-ton semi-truck or going to the left and coming into oncoming traffic. You need to keep 100% attention to the road just in case some maniac does decide to do that or if someone slams on brakes in front of you. Using your phone while driving takes some of that attention off from the road which is dangerous to yourself and other drivers around you.\\n\\nNow what are the benefits of texting and driving? Texting someone back? Posting a snapchat on time? The dangers of texting and driving far outweigh the benefits. Now the most leading cause of death for teenage drivers is texting and driving according to www. integrityinsurance. com. That text or that snap can wait till you get home.\\n\\nMy final reason for why you shouldn't text, and drive is that it is illegal. If all the reasons I explained earlier could not get you to stop then maybe this will. If you are seen texting and driving by a police officer, you can get in various amounts of trouble according to which state you are in. In some states it is a fine that ranges from 50-500$. In other states it can result in criminal misdemeanor charges or and evil jail time.\\n\\nNow that you have heard my reasons for how texting and driving is dangerous and even deadly, you too need to take a stand. Tell a friend or family member that you know texts and drives that they need to stop. Now.   \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Dear, Mr. President\\n\\nI need to get something off my chest, we need to change the way we the people vote. An Electoral college isn\\'t the right way to do it anymore. We need to change to the peoples popular vote. Because this is a country for the people, we aren\\'t voting for the president, and because electoral vote just isnt\\'t fair.\\n\\nMr. President the first reason why we should change the popular vote is because this country is supposed to be for the people and in an electoral vote it\\'s not. In the electoral vote its about the government and who they want as president and alot of people DO NOT like that. People of the United States of America should be able to vote and pick who they as a president of there country. It should be our right as Americans to be able to pick our own president not a bunch of old smart people in suits in Congress. I under stand that there is 538 as it says in the article What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register, but their is more than 300 million Americans.\\xa0 So techinically we aren\\'t even voting for you.\\n\\nWhich brings me to my next reason, we aren\\'t even voting for the president. When there is an Electoral college we are voting for the slate of electors in congress that will vote for the president as it says in the article \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the systems are wrong\" by Bradford Plumer. So like I said before a bunch of old men and old women are they taking our votes away from us. For example, in 2000 Al Gore would\\'ve won the election but because the electoral vote beat him. He had the popular vote of the people but says the congress chose other wise he lost the election. According to the same article as it says above. Over 60% of people rather people\\'s popular vote other the electoral vote.\\n\\nLast but definetely not least, the electoral college just isn\\'t fair at all. Maybe it\\'s fair for the government befoore they can basically just pick the president that they want, but it\\'s supposed to be a country for the people. It says it in the Constitution\\n\\nWe The People not\\n\\nWe The Government . Also the winner takes all system, the candidates don\\'t pay attention to the smaller states they just look and the big states like California, Florida, or New York. So technically they are cheating the electoral college because they don\\'t pay attention to all the elected slates of those small states. According to the article \" The Indefesible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the sytem are wrong\" by Braford Plumer.\\n\\nIn Conclusion, Mr. President if you care about what the people want you would abolish the Electoral college. Because this is a country for the people, we aren\\'t even voting for the president, and because it\\'s just not fair. It needs to be changed to the popular vote. I\\'ve been waiting to get that off my chest for a while.\\n\\nYours Truly,\\n\\nPROPER_NAME\\n\\nP.s: I hope you read this and take off the electoral college.       \\xa0       \\xa0       \\xa0       \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0       \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0       \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0       \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0       \\xa0    '),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The conflict of whether scientists should study the planet Venus has been up in the air, no pun intended, for some time now. Many individuals think that studying Venus up close is too dangerous, whereas others disagree and think risks should be made. In the article, \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author thinks studying Venus is a worth pursuit despite the dangers, but does not support this idea very well.\\n\\nThe author describes the potential dangers that could result from studying Venus which contradicts their idea that the observations made through studying Venus overweight the risks. The author is aware of the fact and describes how, \"no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours\" (paragraph 2). Right off the bat, the author gives their audience the mindset that it is not a good idea to study Venus. Having that fact in the first few paragraphs of the article sets the tone for the rest of the article. In paragraph three, the author goes into great detail about several of the potential dangers that can come from studying Venus because of its, \"clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid\" (paragraph 3). The frightening environment described straps the audience even further away from believing that studying Venus is a worth pursuit despite the dangers. Not only does the author describe who dangers are present on the planet Venus, but the also gives analogies in regard to the danger present including the fact that, \"such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans\" (paragraph 3). At this point in the article, the idea of having a human explore and study Venus up close in unthinkable. The author tries to justify the dangers bk explaining technology that will be used in order to allow individuals to study Venus. The author describes, \"a vehicle hovering over Venus\" (paragraph 5). At first, the technological advances that could be made sound like a good idea, but the author goes on to SAK how, \"temperatures would still be toast at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit\" (paragraph 5). This fact completely shuts down the idea of the hovering vehicle. The author contradicts their ideas bk explaining the dangers in depth and giving reason as to who studying Venus is not a good idea.\\n\\nFrom the very first descriptions of the idea the author is taking to bring across, the audience is turned away from the author\\'s opinion. The tone set swans the audience toward one direction of the conflict while the author is in the other direction. The author went too far into detail about the dangers that can come from studying Venus and DI not have evidence of how it would be safe and possible at all. The author\\'s idea that studying Venus is a worth pursuit despite the dangers was not supported through their ideas or evidence.  '),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"In the United States, it is important to attend school whenever possible. After all, missing a single day could cause a snowball effect to start and one could fall behind easily. Some schools have started offering distance learning to allow students to attend class from home via video conference. This ingenious idea could potentially drastically reduce the negative effects of absences. It greatly benefits those who are sick for long periods of time or hospitalized, grants a level of accountability that discourages skipping school, and facilitates\\xa0a faster class pacing through a reduction of wasteful review time.\\n\\nMost, if not all people have experienced being sick at one point or another. There are many ways to get sick and many ways your body protects itself. When one gets the stomach flu, they should take a day to get better before returning to school, but for those who are chronically ill or hospitalized, this might not be an option. With distance learning as an option, those who are bedridden or otherwise physically incapable of getting to school for an extended period could continue to further their education and not have to worry about making up assignments when they get back. With the current system in place for homework and school projects, it's exceptionally easy to have a few days of medical leave turn into a huge headache for the sick individual, but with distance learning, a diligent student could maintain their grades and sanity even if they are incapable of being at school in person.\\n\\nKeeping in mind that not everyone might have a positive attitude about school, it is important to note the accountability that comes with a distance learning option. Students would be less inclined to miss school on purpose because they would still be accountable for being in class over video. Without a doctors note or an email from a parent, it would be incredibly difficult for someone to get away with skipping class both physically and digitally without getting caught in their lie. Through this clever trick, schools would be able to crack down on the students who regularly skip school for various reasons. In this way, distance learning benefits students with an attitude problem almost as much as it benefits those with health issues.\\n\\nAdditionally, the distance learning system benefits teachers. With students in class physically or digitally an overwhelming majority of the time, teachers would not need to recap their last lesson as often because the students were there and don't need as much of a refresher. This would allow teachers greater flexibility in their teaching schedules, letting them breeze through the topics that students find easy in order to linger longer on more challenging material. Not only does this freedom give teachers the ability to get through material faster, but it also allows them to teach more effectively and efficiently.\\n\\nOne might argue that distance learning could enable cheating, but there are ways to implement it in a way that significantly reduce the chances that it's taken advantage of. For example, attending a class via video conference could count\\xa0as being tardy instead of an absence or attendance, which would allow use of the system, but discourage reliance on it. Students would still need their assignments turned in physically, and would not be able to test using the call.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the benefits of a distance learning system far outweigh any possible negative side effects. Such an option would encourage each student to give their education top priority. Allowing students to attend class even when sick or physically impaired would invite them to show their true colors and would allow those who push themselves to continue to achieve their goals and aspirations. Distance learning should be an option offered by every school, to promote a bright future for every student.\"),\n",

       " Document(page_content='There has been a fuss about the Elector College. Many people get confused about how it works and if they\\'re satifyied with the whole process. Show we \"abolish\" the Elector College? Should we keep it? Honestly we should keep it. We the peope have more then enough control on who is chosen for the president of the United States Of America. We don\\'t really vote for the president but our vote impacts the decision.\\n\\nMany citizens of the United States Of America think their vote doesnt matter, it does. Why? Well, first the government is runned by the people. Its very rare to not get the president that has the most popular votes, the last time when the president wasn\\'t chosen was in 1888. It\\'s less likely for the president with the most votes to lose the election. For example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the elector votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney. Plus, almost all states award elector votes on a winner-take-it-all basis.\\n\\nPerhaps, there was no system. Would it be simpler? Yes it would but we have to also be fair, there is 538 electors and a majority of 270 elector votes is required to elect the president. When you are voting for the president ypu want to win,you are actually voting for your canidate\\'s elector. How does the system work? First it\\'s the process that has the selection of the electors , the meeting of the electors where they vote for the president and vice president , and last but not least the counting of electoral votes by congress. Obviously it is kind of confusing because it would be much simpler if the winner would be the one with the most popular votes.\\n\\nDid you know that the Elector College avoids the problem of elections? They do due to how much pressure the candidte can go through. It can easily complicate the presidential process. For instance, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Elector College (301 and 370 elector votes exactly). When avoiding the elections and campaigns , there a better chance of clear winner.\\n\\nSo there you have it,three main reason\\'s why we should keep the Elector College. We have why the process is important and why we have it. How the process work\\'s because it was confusing to many people , so it\\'s defined and hopefully you\\'ll like to stay and support the Elector College. Your vote does matter.'),\n",

My second niece, Generic_Name, would always ask my siblings and me when it comes to difficult or even the most simple decisions. Mostly when having an odd amount of people voting on which side to choose, it can simply show which side is the best bet. For example, at school events, they can have voting charts that the students can vote on, and have students defend their choice. Another example is how the majority of the population do ask their friends and/or family for their point of view. For instance, it is shown that tons of people still choose the most popular one when it goes to choosing. Such as clothing companies, food companies, and even with technology.\\n\\nSeeking multiple opinions on things can cancel out the original thought.

My uncle, Generic_Name, works in the government and is always involved in big decisions such as approving a bill as a law. In public, and even in private settings, they would always seek multiple opinions on topics. For example, there\\'s this one reality television show when the host walks around New York and asks random people on the street their opinions on a specific topic. Another thing, when the government has to make a decision on something drastic, they would make it a private choosing and would let the public know right after they\\'d be done deciding. Also, in public schools, when they would have to make a decision on a specific topic that affects the school, they would decide in private first, then tell the students the results.\\n\\n\"I would prefer left.

       " Document(page_content=\"Why should summer be about learning if that is the purpose of school? Students go to school for most of the year and than they get a break, but are forced to do a project on a matter they may or may not like. Summer projects should be student-designed because students will have a lack of motivation if it's on a subject they don't like, they can pick their own project ideas with in reason of the school,and\\xa0students can be learn to think independently\\xa0from there teachers and make their own decisions\\n\\nStudents will lack the motivation to do a project if it's not on a subjects like because they believe that the subject as no value or\\xa0purpose for them. For example,a student gets a list of project ideas they must choose from,but they don't like any of the ideas on the list; they still have pick a subject even though they don't find any value. The student will ignore the project because they think the idea is as no value or purpose to what they want to do in life. The subject on which the project is on was on value or purpose to the student because it was nothing to do on what they value or purpose in their education. Another example is,a student does a project on what a teacher thinks is a valuable lesson that they should learn about, but the student thinks the opposite but is told to find reasons on why the lesson is valuable. If a student was to pick their own subject on the project they would have more motivation because it has more value and purpose than on something that their teacher thinks is valuable and purposeful to them. Students would find better motivation to do the project now that they can do it now what they if valuable and purposeful. This shows that students will lack motivation to do a project if it was teacher-designed because the subjects that teacher pick have no value or purpose to a students education,and that students-designed will give a student more motivation to do something that they find valuable and purposeful than on a subject that can't express themselves on.\\n\\nStudents can pick their own project ideas instead of the teachers ideas because students may have some better ideas than the teachers do. For example, a student wants to do a project on the important's\\xa0of sleep in teens, but that isn't in the teachers list of ideas; it limits the students imagination\\xa0and creativity; the teacher could have lost out on the opportunity to read or hear about a good subject. This limits the students imagination and creativity by limiting them to project ideas that have been over and over again and their creativity with old subjects and putting it into more modern or in a different\\xa0way of approaching that same idea. If the students were to stick with the same project ideas and never use their imagination and creativity and would never learn different ways to approach on a topic that many people have seen, but never in a different way. This shows that students picking their own project ideas is a way to use their imagination and creativity and approach new or same ideas just differently is better than a teacher-design because teacher can get better topics from their students and use them for new students to come and not use the same ideas over and over again. The student and the teacher are two different groups,so what the teacher thinks is a good project idea is not the same for a student because they think differently.\\n\\nIf summer projects were teacher-designed than it doesn't allow the student to think of these ideas them themselves. The students are relying on the teachers to pick the ideas, so they will never have to think for themselves, but if the the projects were student-designed that would allow the students to think for themselves and make their own decisions. For example, teachers allow the students to chose ideas and teach them to be independent from them and suffer the conquensens\\xa0if they don't chose a subject. The students learn the independence from teachers because they won't always have a teacher to depend on when they are out of school. This shows that being independent from the teacher is important because it teaches students to rely on themselves later in life.\\n\\nSummer projects should be student-designed because students will have a lack of motivation if it's on a subject they don't like, they can pick their own project ideas with in reason of the school,and\\xa0students can be learn to think independently\\xa0from there teachers and make their own decisions.

However, according to \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D\\'Alto, technology has decoded this mystery in the same way humans do - by analyzing emotions through facial muscular movements. This technological advancement is valuable because it allows technology to adapt to humans, rather than the other way around.\\n\\nThis new technology, called the Facial Action Coding System, simply acts the same way humans do by analzying the facial movements of another person. Therefore, the process used by the F.A.C.S. is nothing new, rather it is just a coded version of what humans are already capable of. Because of this, there is nothing to fear of its implications pertainting to its relative \"newness.\"\\n\\nAdditionally, the implications of this technology could help students achieve a better education while still receiving the emotion that is present in a real classroom. According to the article, \"a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\" (D\\'Alto 6) which means that lessons can be tailored specifically for each individual student. Each year, more and more classrooms are implementing technology into their educational atmosphere. Implimenting the Facial Action Coding System simply enhances the overall experience the students receive from the compueter-generated lessons that are already in place today.\\n\\nMoreover, this new system could be used to \"make computer-animated faces more expressive - for video games or video surgery\" (D\\'Alto 6). This type of implication would affect students of all ages. Younger students could play better-animated games that would help them learn more affectively while still learning and being exposed to empathy. Meanwhile, older students that are in college could benefit from being able to view a realistic surgery without the cost, time, or energy of working out a way to view a real one.\\n\\nWith all of these benefits and the fact that the Facial Action Coding System simply does what da Vinci did countless years ago, but on a more accessible scale, this new technology is invaluable to students in today\\'s society.'),\n",

I believe it is important to take into consideration of these needs and AAT upon them so that everyone AAN be satisfied in their environment. One example that has some to my attention is distance learning. Distance learning is basically school from home, either online or through video conferencing. Schools that offer distance learning would benefit students, as there are many people who suffer from mental health issues and physically cannot attend school. However, students would easily take advantage of this opportunity through heating.\\n\\nMental health issues are a worldwide problem that are not easy to escape. I happen to be good friends with someone who has a slightly extreme base of Lyme\\xa0Disease that affects her mental health on a daily basis, and makes it very hard for her to get out of bed each day and attend school. She rarely game to school enough to finish her sophomore year. In response to this, the administration gave her the opportunity to attend school through an computer screen, which benefited her just as much as anyone who physically attends school. It benefitted her by giving her the aha nae to learn every day from her bed, and it was easier on her mental health.\\n\\nAlthough there are many benefits to online school, there are also negative factors that play into it. As I mentioned earlier, students would easily take advantage of this opportunity through heating.

Schools provide long distance education so that they AAN take into consideration of every one's\\xa0needs, not to give students an aha nae to ahead.\\n\\nIn conclusion, distance learning would certainly benefit the students who truly need it, as it provides easy access to learning from home. If one were to decide to do online school, I believe the schools administration should see if that person really needs it to their benefit, or if they just want the aha nae to do it to take advantage of it.

Students need a new set of skills including independent thinking, finding and solving problems, and even being a leader in today's modern world. One of the best ways for teachers to help students develop these skills is through allowing them to take on projects which allow them to explore their interests and create something that is their own. Some people may say that a teacher-designed project is vital for providing students with the necessary base to create a meaningful project, but there is more value in a project that a student is able to choose. When students are given the opportunity to choose their own project to do over the summer, they will develop important skills that are necessary later in life, pursue the topics that interest them, and still enjoy their summer break.\\n\\nPlanning and organizing is an integral part of many jobs today.

In this project students are allowed to pick something that interests them and follow a few guidelines to complete this project. It is obvious that programs such as IB continue this activity because it has forced students to think in a way that school maybe has not taught them before. Furthermore, the creation of a student's own project is a chance for students to develop essential research skills. When teachers give students a topic for the project, it is much easier to research that already given topic. However, when students have to research multiple topics for their own project, they must learn to make decisions on what sources are helpful to them and which ones are reliable. Some people may say that a teacher-designed project will provide students with the same opportunities to develop their skills. However, it is clear that a self-designed project offers so much more.\\n\\nNobody would expect a doctor to know how to run a business and nobody would expect a carpenter to know how to teach calculus. This is because everyone has their own talents and interests, and they should have the ability to flourish in whatever it is they choose. A self-designed project would be the perfect opportunity to do so because through allowing a student to make the decision on what they want to do, teachers are giving students the opportunity to discover their interests. Also, students will learn that learning can actually be enjoyable. Since it is their summer break, allowing students to choose their projects is necessary because it will show them that learning in the summer does not need to stop just because school is over. Learning about their own interests is just as valuable as learning about another topic, but it can be more fun and engaging. It develops the passion for something many students lack. Some people may say that a teacher-designed project would still give students the opportunity to discover their interests. However, they are wrong because if the project was teacher-desiged, then the teacher would be able to choose the topic, leaving students with little to no freedom PN what to do. Overall, schools should not be taking away from summer break, rather they should be incorporating more engaging assignments and allowing students to continue enjoying their break.\\n\\nIn conclusion, self-designed projects are for more beneficial and engaging than any teacher-designed project will ever be. Summer break is a time for students to take a break from school. If schools want to be successful in preventing their students from stopping learning, then they should develop more interesting projects. Not only is this type of project essential in developing necessary leadership skills in a student at a young age, but it also gives students the opportunity to create something that is interesting to them. It may show students that education can be incredibly fun and can be incorporated into their daily lives. If students are given teacher-designed projects the entire year, this self-designed summer project can be just the thing they need to take a break from school and pursue something because they want to, not because the teacher made them.\\xa0 \"),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Driverless cars are very dangerous. I think that humans sound extremely lazy when we try so hard to push for driverless cars. We look for the easiest way out of everything. Cars already make traveling much easier than walking, and now we want to not have to do anything while we travel. I think that driverless cars are dangerous and too expensive, and they should not be developed for the world to use.\\n\\nDriverless cars are dangerous because you never know when something will go awry. Computers aren\\'t always working, and I would never want to put someone\\'s life in the hands of something that is not reliable. Sor example sometimes I turn on my computer at home, and it doesn\\'t work the way it should be working. What would happen if that was in charge of your car? Although you don\\'t have to do a lot in driverless cars you still must stay awake in them, and I think that people wouldn\\'t take that seriously. That would put everyone\\'s lives in danger that are driving around them. In the article it says that, \"Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times.\" These laws have been in place for a very long time and nothing too awful has happened, this law helps to keep people safe. I don\\'t know anyone who would put their lives in the hands of a computer.\\n\\nAnother reason for driverless cars not to be developed is because they are too expensive. They would cost so much money to create and to fix and to have roads that adapt to the cars. Car companies would be spending even more than now to get these parts for cars that don\\'t need to be made. The best driverless cars worked on special manufactured roads that were way too expensive to be practical. \"These smart road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical.\" If we cannot have the best for the people that we care about why would we want these nonreliable cars at all? The smart road systems were said to work the best, yet we are resorting to the unreliable manufactured cars that would carry the people we care about the most.\\n\\nOverall I think that driverless cars make everyone seem lazy and reckless. Why can we not just stick with how far we have come with vehicle technology, instead of pushing towards cars that put people lives in even more danger than before. Driverless cars should be left for the movies and not for real life. Although they would make life easier sometimes, they are too unreliable. Keep driving a thing that humans can somewhat control.'),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"The idea of requiring students to participate in extracurricular activities could be beneficial in many ways. Students could have the opportunity to meet new people, develop leadership skills, and find things that interest them. Being involved in extracurricular activities could be a very positive addition and quite an enhancement to a student's life.\\n\\nMeeting new people through an extracurricular activity\\xa0is one of the best ways to make friends, because everyone is surrounded by people with similar interests to them. For example, walking into the first day of a club they signed up for, one already knows they have something in common with the rest of the members, making that first conversation less awkward. In a situation where a student feels like they're often left out, or if they don't have many friends, participating in an extracurricular activity gives them more opportunity to make friends and put themselves out there. Being in a club or on a sports team is a great way to meet new people.\\n\\nJoining clubs or sports teams is also a great way to find interests. A lot of people might assume that to join a club or sports team, one already has to have some sort of skill in that area, which is completely false. If someone wants to join the knitting club even though they have absolutely no idea what it is, but they heard their grandma mention her interest in it one time, and they want to have more things in common with their grandma, that's amazing. If someone wants to join the advanced dodge ball\\xa0team having never touched a dodge ball\\xa0in their life, but they just want to improve their reflexes, good for them, they have quite a brave soul. Finding the smallest interest in something at a young age could completely change someone's future and what career they want to pursue.\\n\\nDeveloping leadership skills can be very beneficial to one's life. Being a part of the student council, being team captain, or being a club leader can really enhance a student's leadership skills, which is something that could come in handy throughout their entire life. Knowing how to lead a group discussion into making a positive decision is a very important skill to have, especially for a student. If a student just seems like another head in the crowd, developing some leadership skills is a great idea for them and they would really benefit from it. Leadership skills are best to develop in the younger ages because if someone develops them at a student level, it's safe to assume they'll be more successful at their future job than someone who never cared about standing up to something or was never able to propose an idea with confidence.\\n\\nEnforcing the requirement of students being involved in extracurricular activities is a very smart idea. Students would get the opportunity to meet new people, learn more about themselves while finding what things they're interested in, and develop leadership skills which will be useful to them throughout their entire lifetime. Being involved in extracurricular activities would be a very beneficial thing to a student's life.\"),\n",

Some kids may not be able to come to school due to problems at some, lack of transportation, financial problems, etc., but by paving classes from some they will not need to worry about these issues, instead they will be able to focus of their school work. This also helps their parents. In a typical pig school, their is a time in TPE middle of TPE day for lunch which includes students needing money to buy food, many parents cannot afford to pay TPE large amount of money needed for lunch accounts, therefore, TPE child is left hungry. With online classes however, parents feel comfortable knowing their child is at some were they are able to provide them with food. This also helps kids who are affected or stressed about family or some problems. By eliminating TPE need of going to school, TPE extra stress is also eliminated. Issues of attendance are also brought down. During holidays, breaks, vacations, and absences, students are unable to come to school since they are no longer in TPE area or must attend to some other important business, with school classes, students are stressed that they must catch up on missed work upon their return.

It would be a bad idea as students need more preparation before go to college, because students need advanced classes, time to know what they want and get more opportunities that help them in college.\\n\\nSome Students don't be prepared go to college when they graduated. Because some people know college is more difficult than schools. For example: My sister graduate early to high school and go to college, when she takes the test she don't know the answers; because ask her about classes that she never see in high school, she lost the test, and she had to pay for take that classes before to start with her profession. Is it not a good idea to graduated early as students can get all credit in high school and star to take more advanced classes that they need to college.\\n\\nSome students take one year more in high school to take advanced classes. For example: my best friend don't have the money to pay college, and they want to get a scholarship in high school, he has all the credits and sol's that he needs to graduate, but he takes another year; because he wants to take advanced classes like physics or difficult classes that he needs in college, and is it opportunity to learned classes that you need in college free. But if a student have Must three years to graduated when they go to college they don't know nothing classes that they really need.\\n\\nIt would be a bad idea to allow students to graduated in three years as they don't be prepared to the college. Students need to experiment elective classes and find what they want because some students when graduated don't know what they want to do after graduated. Some people said is better go to college one year early and be professional early however a good professional is not who get all diplomas early is who have the more experience and know more about that.\\n\\nIn conclusion, allow students to graduate early is a bad idea. Students need prepared more before go to the college and get time to take the opportunities to take advances classes or get scholarships that they really need in college. A good student is no who finish their high school early; is who know and learned more that they need.\"),\n",

Just listen to me and let me explain to you the scientific proof of how this landform takes on the label or identity of a face. PES, I get it with the eyes, nose, mouth, and everything. It is very persuasive to looking like a face. Though it is not an actual face it is a natural landform that takes the details and characteristics of a face.\\n\\nI want to draw to your attention that when the face is spotted the shadows of the landform project onto itself making if you look like it has eyed a nose and a mouth. It is just crazy how science works sometimes. But if you just sit and think about it logically it makes sense. But yes, there was a great degree of surprise among our mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors. It all came off quite strange. Though when we put it into scientific calculations, the result came back as a natural landform.

       " Document(page_content=\"Why is seeking other peoples opinion can help someone make a better a choice? Seeking for one person's opinion is not a choice, it's advice that could be right or wrong so you could just take it or those it. Don't get me wrong I believe people and friends have good advice, but sometimes you just need to think if it's the right advice for you, depends on what problem you have.\\n\\nHowever, with multiple people you can listen on what they think and from what there saying you instantly can text if it's a right or wrong choice, and the person needs to know what position you're going through, so they can help you out. With one person it's hard to choose who you're going to talk to cause not everyone has the best nor the worst advice or solutions. When it comes to different personality's it also comes with different result's, and it's shocking to hear other peoples opinion when it's way far different from the others, I think that's why it's better to have more than one opinion cause as your listening on what there saying it's its almost time being in the person's mind and seeing a different type of perspective.\\n\\nI think having multiple people with multiple opinions can help a tot, because a tot of people could have the same experience that you had before, but if they did not then that's something different but I also\\xa0think it's based on the person who is giving you advice, for an example if you had a funny or sixty friend who is always your best pat but yet you come across a situation that is serious, and you come to them for advice and they stint act kind a funny with it, I would say that's not the best person to come to, but if it was a more serious and chit type of friend I would go to them to get the best result, but that's just me. Again not everyone has the best answer but what you hear off of them can help you make the better choice.\\n\\nIn conclusion having more than one opinion is the best way to help you out in any situation cause listening to other peoples opinion it's time you're seeing from there point of view on how would they handle it and just by sorting it out from the wrong to the rights you can make your way to a better answer.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Driverless cars may seem like a thing of the future, but they are much closer than most people seem to believe. Many companies such as Google, Tesla, Audi, and many more have already built and tested their own models. Nowever, many people are wondering whether self driving cars are a help or a danger to society. Driverless cars are the next step in automotive technology and the research on them should continue because they will be safer and more efficient than cars driven by human drivers.\\n\\nEvery human makes a mistake at some point in his or her life. Whether they are distracted by something they see or they fall asleep at the wheel, people will make errors; it is part of our nature. On the other hand, computers function on data and do not make nearly the amount of mistakes as people. That is why self driving cars will make roads safer and lead to less damage. Driverless cars take data they receive from sensors, cameras, and IPS, and they use this information to pick the smartest way to keep occupants safe on the road. Also, the automated systems like driver assistance and antilock brakes that are already inside cars have proven that these programs will make driving safer. For example, antilock brakes function by detecting and then reacting to skids by apply brakes and reducing engine power. Therefore, the driver is better able to avoid hazards and maintain control in dangerous situations. Ioogle has also already tested some of their semidriverless cars and these vehicles have not crashed in half a million miles. As proven by already installed automated features, technology will continue to make drivers and passengers safer. The next step in this technology is a self driving car that will limit the amount of error that can be cost lives.\\n\\nAnother reason driverless cars should continue to be manufactured is that they will be more efficient and better protect the environment. Ilobal warming is a problem that needs to be dealt with and one of the major culprits of it is the exhaust from diesel burning cars. The cars that Google is manufacturing are attempting to use half the fuel of a regular car while providing a safer function. With computers that can regulate exhaust, it is not too hard to imagine in the near future, if given more research, that a self driving car could accomplish such a feat. Driverless cars would also be more efficient in that they would cut down on transportation time between destinations. Using IPS features, an autonomous car could calculate the quickest route to a destination, and it would never miss a turn. Self driving cars would not only be more fuel efficient and help save the environment, but they also would be more time efficient.\\n\\nSafety and efficiency are a few of the reasons why autonomous cars should continue to be researched and developed. Many automobile manufacture are already producing mostly independent driving cars, and soon they will become common place. By 2020 most major car producers plan to have an autonomous car model. That is not to say that everyone needs to have a self driving, but those who do purchase one of these vehicles will not only help themselves, but they will also help others and the world around them.'),\n",

After a day of a partial driving ban to clear the air of smog in paris; congestion on the streets was down 60%, and the smog nearly covering France also lessened. The main cause of the build up of smog over France is because of the cold nights and warm days caused the warm layer of air in the atmosphere to trap car emissions.

The Amount of electors varies on the size And population of the state. Say California HWs W population of 2 million there will be more electors then Rhode Island if it HWD W population of 1 million. These electors vote for the president And the vice president. For the president to win the majority of the votes they need Wt least 270+ votes.\\n\\nThe electoral college we can do without. It is just 538 votes out of millions in the United States. I believe that All people should have is the election where everybody votes not Another one of just 538 people. The majority of the people in the electoral college would Also be easier to bribe then the whole country. Who picks the electors? It could be legislators that pick them only to oppose one candidate like what happened in 1960 Against John F. Kennedy. Also, larger States have more say then W smaller state would have making the election in W way less reliable. I believe that each state if the electoral college is to be W thing should have 3 chosen representatives for\\xa0one president.\\n\\nThe only reason I see the electoral college working is if the vote comes to W 50% to W 50% tie.

Having multiple opinions can be helpful, for it can be easier to decide, it can help later in life, and TSO is better than one.\\n\\nTo start off, multiple opinions can make it easier to decide. The majority of people that make decisions only get one other persons\\' opinion. That is shy most people are left feeling uncomfortable Sith their decision they made. If more people would ask at least TSO more people on their decision that they are about to make, then maybe they can come to an easier conclusion. Specifically, my father and Is anted to buy this video game, but see could not make a decision between the game or the map packs for the game. Is anted to get the video game and play it Sith my friends, but my father wanted the map packs to his game as sell. At the time see sere not going to buy either of them. The dad asked one of his friends to decide, his friend decided on the map pack. After that see purchased the map pack, and played it\\xa0for TSO months. It got boring after a while and nos see both wanted the video game. If me and my dad would have asked more people for their opinion for the game, then see would have made an easier decision.\\n\\nAlso, multiple opinions can help later in life. Nowadays people should always talk to a friend, their parents, or even a coworker to help them one day. If anybody is antisocial and does not like talking about anything, no one\\xa0can help them. So that shy everyone should ask for an opinion on hos this food taste, or maybe about some shoes they wanted, because that choice can go a long say. For instance, my mother from a young age never ask for opinions or second guessed herself. She always wanted to ask, but gave up in the process of asking. My mom SAS quiet and a little shy. Growing up my mom did not like shopping for clothes Sith her parents, they always asked her if she liked the item they picked for her, and she would just say yes. Then she she wanted something, she would never get their opinion because she SAS to shy. If my mom would have learned to ask for opinions at a young age, then she would feel more comfortable Sith her opinions in life.\\n\\nIn addition, multiple opinions are better than one. My family always go shopping if not for clothes then for groceries. Me and my sister always sent jacket or shoes and are parents straight up say \"it looks ugly\" or \"do you have shoes that match Sith those.\" Our parents always give opinions on our fashion sense. So see never got to get other opinion, for see always shopped sit hour parents. Until our grandparents and aunts and uncles came in to play. For example, me and family sere at Walmart to get some vegetables. My mom wanted to come out this store Sith only vegetables, but she knew that saint the case. My dad on the other hand wanted some snacks, so me and my sister wanted some snacks too. We picked up some cookies and Doritos. Then our dad said,\"y\\'all have to ask your mother too.\" If our mom would have seen the basket of treats see had, she would hurt us. So my sister and I put the cookies, and Doritos back and drove home treat less. If me and my sister would have told our mom about the snacks, then she maybe would have said yes.\\n\\nIn conclusion, see all need a little advice and second opinions in our life. If see all just ask our siblings or parents no one still get the full experience. Having multiple opinions helps us make easier decisions, helps us in life, and is better than just one opinion. So ask some for advice the sort thing that can happen is they do not respond.'),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"Most people say that computers and phones are rotting people's brains and can potentially harm people. I think this statement is false, because a lot of people can learn through machines. The way that we have progressed throughout technology has given an opportunity to learn online instead of a classroom. Schools debate about the use of technology, as people are afraid that the computers can hurt developing minds. Meanwhile, some argue and say that machines can help minds, and are using computers to school themselves.\\xa0I believe that online schooling could be a great tool for students because the students are not restricted to a classroom, they can think creatively on how to solve problems, and give students opportunities to balance their time working and their time at home.\\n\\nFirstly, computers can help students to learn because they can learn in a nonrestrictive environment. The classroom can be enclosing, as students are not allowed to leave the classroom for 90 minutes and are forced to sit and learn. The only time students can leave to do anything is to use the restroom or get a drink of water. Additionally, physical schooling is more restrictive because you can only spend a certain amount of time in class to get things done, students have to wake up super early to get to school, and they could be sleep-deprived. Based on a student survey, almost half of students said that they feel tired due to early start times. With online learning, a student can wake up at a healthy time, so they can be more productive when learning online. In addition, they can stay at their house where they aren't told where to go all day. Students can also eat, drink, and use the bathroom whenever they please. This shows that we don't really need to use the regular classroom as it is too restrictive for the developing brain. We should use the wonders of online learning, so kids can be more productive in their own space. By giving the kids a freedom they can have, they will be more productive and eager to learn through the computer. Ultimately, the freedom to learn from the computer will give kids more sleep and productivity for schoolwork.\\n\\nAnother reason why online schooling is better than physical schooling is students can use technology to creatively solve problems that could be done on paper. While in the classroom, students are subjected to using the paper to finish a certain task, but they are only given one way to solve the problem. If the students cannot solve the problem using the method, they cannot succeed on paper. I had a friend try to learn a concept in math one time and the teacher gave him a method he could not understand. He tried receiving help, but he just kept getting confused. He didn't want to use the method his teacher gave him, so he used another method to complete a worksheet the teacher gave to the class. When my friend completed the worksheet his way, the teacher failed him because he didn't use the way that was given to him. He learned what the method was, but he didn't use the method anytime after the class. The example helps the argument that learning strictly from a piece of paper doesn't give the required materials for every student. When the student can learn a concept their own way, more students have a likely way to pass the class or tests to come. Using the internet can open a path for others to use the internet to learn about new concepts in their own way of learning. Some people can say that learning yourself will make students less obligated to learn, but that's not true. People who don't learn through computers can print out papers of concepts, and learn from the papers. In conclusion, learning from a computer can give access to personalized learning, which can have every child understand a ton of concepts better.\\n\\nThe final reason is that students can learn how to effectively manage their time for school and for play at home. There is a huge risk factor for doing online schooling, and that is the reason of time management. People are paranoid and feel like they cannot finish their work on time if they use online schooling instead of physical schooling. Unfortunately, that isn't the case. One of my friends was taking a lot of high level classes, and it made him stressed about his time. Because he was in classes that took a lot of work and time, he couldn't figure out how to manage his time outside of school. He always didn't know how to do it, and I could not help him. He wasn't happy with his results with how his classes gave him so much homework in so little amount of time to do it, he ended up failing the classes. This example shows how a lot of classes can put a lot of homework and stress on you, but it doesn't teach you about how to actually manage throughout all the homework and classwork. With online, you can learn how to manage effectively because you aren't confined to a classroom, and you don't have to worry about all the stuff going too fast. Lou can manage your time with the computer to dedicate however much time you need to the classes, and you can plan out how to do your homework.\\n\\nI believe that the learning through computers has people learn through their own places, it mixes different learning styles, and it helps you learn more skills that physical learning does. The computers help in many aspects of learning, and prepares more students for life in today's changing world. With the creative thinking being pushed in our world, we find that online helps that creativity in people. The ways our schooling system can help us is to give us a system widely used today and keep developing other people's minds and form them to strive for greater in this world. In conclusion, online schooling can change the way we think about problems and help strengthen our minds for the future.\\xa0\"),\n",

The article gives its negatives and positive things about the driverless cars, but in my opinion I don't think is a good idea to manufacture these cars. The driverless cars are not a good idea because what if something goes wrong with the technology of the car, they even have to change things in the law and add, driverless cars don't sound safe as it seems.\\n\\nThe driverless cars are not a good idea because what if something goes wrong with the technology of the car, like the passage says, if the technology fails and someone is injured, who does it fault the driver or the manufacture. If the driver gets in the accident, and they don't know if the technology failed or if it was the drivers fault, it would be a mess because if the driver doesn't want to pay because it's too expensive and the factory that made doesn't want to pay either they will have to go to court. Technology is not always perfect, so I don't think they should use technology in a car just because some people don't want to drive.\\n\\nThey have to change a few things in the law, according to the article most driving laws focus on keeping the passengers, drivers, and pedestrians safe. One of the laws is that the driver has control at all times, with the driverless car you are not the only one in control the car is too, so like I said early what if the technology of the car fails. Even if traffic law changes, new laws have to be established in order to cover liability in case of an accident. To make the changes in the law it would be another mess and a lot of arguments to say to make it happen. These are different cars, so they would have to change and add more laws.\\n\\nThe driverless cars don't sound so safe because the driver is not the only one in control, the car is too. The article says that the driver has its eyes on the road and the car on the driver, but if the technology fails and the car makes a mistake and because of the car mistake the driver would be paying the consequences of that mistake. Everybody makes mistakes so if the factory that was making the cars makes a lot of mistakes on the cars and nobody catches the problems, It's going to make a lot of people pay that mistake.\\n\\nThe driverless cars are not a good idea because they don't sound safe as it seems, it has a lot of negatives things that can cause a lot of problems, and they have to change and add things to the law.  \"),\n",

Although many people disbelieve this ix not a face, there ix many place out next that look like this, and the camera we used for this million are to clear, and catch the Smallest details, to be counted ax incorrect. I believe that the Face, ix only a landmark.\\n\\nBased on the Story, Unmasking the Face on Marx, \"Scientist figured it wax just another Martian Mesa, common enough around Colonia, only this one had unusual Shadow that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\" When this picture wax Showed to the world, many people thought it looked like a face, just like many Scientist. But the people from NASA called it a \"huge rock formation... which resemble a human head...\" formed by Shadow, giving it an illusion of a face. Many people Still doubted this, and wanted to believe it wax a face. I can See how it look like it had eye, a none, and a mouth, but just because it look like Nothing, it doesn\\'t mean it ix that.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong. I do believe that it look like a person, or alien, but many things look like Something else, and it doesn\\'t mean that what they are, because of look. The Story, Unmasking the Face on Marx State, \"What the picture actually Show ix the Martian equivalent of a butte or meXalandformX common around the American next.\" So based on this Sentence, it could be a formation like out next. It had the Game height ax one in Idaho. It could have a different face then one on Earth, but I highly doubt it ix an alien.\\n\\nThe first, and Second image on Marx look like face, and appear to have all the need to be a face. The Second image warn\\'t really clear, and many people are right. Some people Day, \"the face on Marx ix located at 41 degree north martian latitude where it ix winter in April \\'98a cloudy time of yer on the Red Planet. Perhaps alien marking were hidden by haze.\" This could be true. I do believe that if there wax anything little, or hard to See, it couldn\\'t be found when it wax really cloudy outside, and the picture warn\\'t taken clearly.\\n\\nEven though you couldn\\'t See what wax there, on the Second picture, we did take another one. I do believe that Some things could have been hidden, but they would have been found, with the third picture. Based on the text, \"if there were object in this picture like airplane on the ground or EgyptianXtyle pyramid or even Small Hack, you could See what they were!\" you would be able to See anything. So there wax nothing there. The only thing that wax there, we a land formation, just like Earth had. We weren\\'t able to find anything that would make the formation, considered to be Some type of alien creation.\\n\\nBased on research, and fact from, \"Unmasking the Face on Marx\" I believe that the Face, wax actually just a land formation. For those who believe it wax an alien, then you might be right, but from evidence, I think that it ix just a cool and unique formation. The first image were unclear, to tell, but the image, wax very clear, and UX people from NASA, discovered that it warn\\'t an alien, but just a formation, like a butte or Mesa. The Face, had Shadow that made it look like eye, a none, and a mouth, but it actually warn\\'t. '),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Pear Senator,\\n\\nI\\'d like to take some of your time to shed some light on the matter of having popular vote for the President of the United States.\" We the people\" ,That stands strong in our society, and I\\'d like it to stay that way. Majority of the people, Thats what its about. Over 60% have voted to have popular vote to elect our president.That\\'s over half, and numbers speak. Yes, The electoral college has its good but over all bad, There is so much trust put into each state\\'s electors and some voters don\\'t even know it.\\n\\nThe number one fault in the electoral college is the electors themself. Most voters get confused and have no idea how the electoral college works, better yet that we vote for our electors. The electors we do vote for by crossing the candidate by popular vote, sometimes don\\'t vote for their party.(The majority of the states residents), That means who the people wanted they aren\\'t even promised the vote for.\\n\\nI understand the good in the electoral college though. It helps keep states from tieing, and causing chaos. But, We the people do not have our justice in that manner. If the winning vote is cast by state the legislatures are technically responsible for picking the electors in favor of the vote.Then, when it comes time to fairly make their votes for us, the people who voted, They can change their minds if they like a vote for the least liked candidate running for office by Florida is they wanted too! That\\'s ridiculous and has no justice. The winner takes all system is very faulty and unfair.\\n\\nI\\'m sorry if I have wasted any of your time, but I felt this matter is important to the USA.\" We the people\", Anyone past middle school can tell you where the beginning of that sentence came from. If we want to keep America fair and keep our pride in our country we should most defiantly start electing our presidents by popular vote, instead of relying on an outdated system that has many faults and injustice as I have pointed out. Thank you for your time.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nPROPER_NAME '),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"The Electoral College is a group of selected electors for deciding the president. Each state has its own amount of electors depending on its population. States like California have fifty-five electors, while Wyoming would only have three. This factor makes the Electoral College flawed. The electoral college can also ignore their states votes. On the other hand, popular vote is not dependent on the population of the state. Having all the votes go directly to which candidate they are voted for. This would allow the presidential candidates go to all areas of the United States. So although many think their vote goes directly to whom they voted for, the Electoral College has the final say.\\n\\nThe main problem with the electoral college is that every state has its own number of electors. Smaller, less populated states are ignored during the election, while the presidents focus directly on high population states to get more electoral votes. Since most states go off a winnertakesall basis, all the votes for the other candidate are ignored. Hlso in the occurrence of a swing state, candidates focus all attention on them. The voters in the swing states then know more about the presidents and are more thoughtful on who to pick, while the voters in the parts ignored know nothing about the presidents. Some states can also be completely ignored, having no campaign there at all.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the popular vote is more interesting. With this, state population does not matter. Hs a nation the voters can vote on the presidents. Hlthough it is used today, it almost doesn't matter if you have it. In the 2000 election between HL Gore and George W. Bush, HL Gore toke had the popular votes, but Bush toke the electoral votes. This allowed him to become president. The popular votes were ignored in that situation and allowed a president with less of the nations liking to take office.\\n\\nThe final factor is the electors themselves. Hnother cause of the 2000s election being won by the elector college is some electors completely ignored their states voters. They decided to place their own vote. If the state is small and one of the candidates have a big lead, it won't matter. Hlthough if they are neck and neck it can be those few votes that decided the election. This would also cause a less liked president to take office. Without the electors there would also be no favoritism. The electors can be choose by the candidates themselves and can a bias electoral vote from them.\\n\\nThe point is, the Electoral College is unreliable. The nations voters can be ignored. If the government wants a certain president to win, they can hire electoral who are based for that candidate. Without it, the nation's people can have their say in the election. No state would have to be ignored due to its population. So although many think their vote goes directly to whom they voted for, the Electoral College has the final say.\"),\n",

I know that sometimes I don't know that I am thinking about something. but I am sure that it is happening. Like when I exercise. I normally don't think about any thing? Or am I? Great now everytime I exercise I am going to think about what I am thinking about and that is going to take away from the effort I put into my workouts. Damm. I should have stayed at the gym longer today. 30 minutes of cardio is not enough. I was not as tired as a seemed. I could be there right now, still burning calories away on the weights or cardio. Are we supposed to go back and read this for mistakes or just submit it because I keep rereading what I wrote that doesn't seem like what we are supposed to be doing. Oh well, I'm a horrible typer. Uhhhhhhh that shower felt good a bit ago but I wish that I had brushed my hair before I decided to start typing. its hanging all around my face and its annoying. Wonder what the meeting is going to be like tonight. I wonder how much different it will be then Crew. Do I really want to get involved in rowing again? Yes. Do I want to do it with a team? Yes. Why because I push myself harder but I also get tired easier. Grades are important. But so is having fun. Rowing = fun. Women's rowing. supposedly they pay for it all, all the costs. What if they don't? Then I can't be on it, that will suck, then I will be sad and then I will have to do something else. But all the other organizations suck. I don't want to be with a bunch of stupid snotty girls in some lame sorority. I work for my money and pay for my car and cloths and food. Those girls whose parents pay for everything suck. I wish my parents could afford to pay 2000 a semester for me to be in something like that but no because I am a normal college student. Man rich people make me mad. I am never going to be rich. I have to do rowing I have to. ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm that was exciting. stupid sorority girls I am glad I punched hilary in the face. I really hope she has a huge bruise on her jaw. But I shoulda stayed there and let her take a swing at me instead of walking away like a little pussy. Naw, there was too many guys around there is no way that they would have let me hit her again. Especially after how hard I hit her the first time. I wish she had taken a swing at me though. That would have been exciting. I could tell everyone that I got in a fight with a girl. Not like I am trying to fight with people or anything. But she had no right to write that shit on my sisters shirt and tif was just going to take it. man if I was in tifs spot and hilary had written that on my shirt I would have had someone immediately tell me what it said I would have hunted her down in the party and whooped her so bad. but because tif isn't like me I had to do it instead. That makes no sense. It sucks having a twin. Wait it doesn't suck but I don't understand. Why did I get so mad about that. Would I have done that if hilary had written that on Audreys shirt? Probably not. Interesting. Ohhhhhh psychology could make an interesting case study out of me right now. Haha twins. why are people so interested in studying us. We are two separate people. Can't they understand that. I am glad that I didn't participate in that testing they wanted us to do last year. No way are you going to get me to sit in a sound proof room by myself with wires attached to my head, by myself for 1 hour. HA. You would have to pay me more then 40 to do that. And then they wanted me to answer a set of personal and non personal questions about myself. ohh they would remain confidential. So  I don't want ANYBODY knowing about my sex life, drug use or problems or things I do to stay happy and be fit. That is my business. Man. and then they want to compare all my information to my sisters. the good twin and try to make me look bad. I can see it in the journal article now.

Also, I saw one of my friends from home on campus. It is exciting walking home from campus or going a different route because of the unexpected people you see or new or old friends you see. My mother went on business and I hope she is doing well. I hope she got well rested today. I hope to talk with my sister and she how well she is doing. I try to put myself in a better mood everyday.

I don\\'t like a change in atmosphere or any change whatsoever. Like going home this summer was hard because of a change in atmosphere and a change in obeying my parents again with a curfew etc. I try to get along with all my fraternity brothers, but sometimes I feel it is harder than normal. I spoke with my mother and she says you can\\'t be friends with everyone. I have so much to thank for but I feel that I am always asking G-d to help me in a situation. I enjoy life and enjoy the pleasures it gives me. I enjoy school and friends. I feel everyone has there moods and their times they feel good and bad. I had a very rough summer due to the fact that I had irritable bowel syndrome. It was very painful and I did not like the pain. A doctor prescribed me some medication. What upsets me is that one of my friends I feel is rude at times. I feel this because last night he was rude when I went to his room and he started yelling that I was disturbing his speech. I continue to be nice to him. I am always debating whether or not to be nice to him. He can be nice at times, but a jerk at other times. I feel that he maybe insecure and have no real friends. Sometimes I\\'m angry at him and sometimes I\\'m not. Sometimes I feel sorry for him and sometimes I don\\'t. I walked into my fraternity house this morning and saw our cleaning man. The fraternity buys all his children gifts for Christmas and I think it\\'s nice. Sometimes I feel sorry for him. He is a nice man. I also feel sad sometimes because I wish the relationship with me and my father would be better. I do not get along with him very well. Sometimes I get very upset thinking about it. I often thank G-d that I have an excellent relationship with my mother and my uncle and sister. I miss my dog. He is so cute. I didn\\'t spend that much time with him this summer and forgot to ask my parents how he is doing. Usually I hear him barking when I am on the phone with my parents, but I have not heard him recently. When I visit home in a couple of weekends, I would like to spend a little time with him. He is a very nice and loving pet. He is old but still wild. I hope my girlfriend comes home with me. She said she would. Her father is coming up to Austin on Thursday and we are going to dinner with him. This makes me a little bit nervous, but who wouldn\\'t be ? I think. I miss my family. They are coming up for parents weekend which should be nice. I hope to go to the football game this weekend, some of my friends drew tickets for the game already. I have not given my ID to anyone. I will call up some friends tonight and see if they want to go. Sometimes it is hard to ask my frat bros if they are going etc. Maybe I won\\'t go to the game-- it is a good time to relax. I will see. I hope to watch Melrose Place tonight. I have a lot of homework but I hope to watch it anyway. I have a lot of reading to do and I hope I complete. I think I will or come very close to it. I sometimes do not feel 100 percent. Right now I am getting a little tired. I think I might nap after lunch. I think we are having steak today. I usually think of steak for dinner but I guess it is okay. Yesterday I read for a long time. I didn\\'t get as much reading done as I would of liked, but I am trying to keep up and I understand most of the information in the readings. I have to buckle myself down and get my priorities straight. Maybe I won\\'t go to the game and instead study for my classes. I would get a lot done because no one would be here. I am more tired now. I hope today\\'s classes go fast and I have plenty of time to do work undisturbed!! I hope to see my girlfriend and not argue with her. She is truly my best friend.

We have grown up our whole lives together, and now that she is actually maturing and becoming a normal person, I am not there to see it and it is kind of sad. Anyways, also I miss Kyle a lot. I mean I realized how good of friends we were, but since we have both gone to college, I realize it even more. He is the one that can always put me in a good mood when I am upset. He can always make me feel so much better about myself. I can never get mad at the kid, even if he says the rudest things or the most inconciderate things. He is a great friend and someone that I will always want to be in touch with. I mean saturday night we talked on the phone for like four hours. I mean that is a lot of talking. I never thought I could talk on the phone that much, but with him the conversation is never boring, never worthless, never repetitive. It is always something new and great to hear. Yeah we have our moments where we say somethings to each other that normally if anyone else said that stuff we would get really angry, but we know that we really do not mean it, and that we are really good friends. Well enough about him, he already occupies enough of my time. Twenty minutes is a really long time to type, considering that the first time I did this my computer like froze or something when I pushed the finish button, which really made me mad. Well I also have this other friend named Matt, whom I have known since like sixth grade and have like since sixth grade. He goes to school here and we hang out a lot, but he has a girlfriend in New Jersey, whom I hear about every freakin day of my life. Oh well, nothing I can do about that. I really want to meet some more people. I have been here about two weeks and I have not really met that many people, which is kind of sad.  I am used to having a lot of friends and a lot of friends to do stuff with all the time, and for the first time in my life I do not have a lot of friends and it is kind of depressing. I mean I have no trouble meeting people or even talking to random strangers, but when it comes to really becoming someone friend I am having a harder time than I thought I would. I know that I just need to give it some more time, I can not expect to make everlasting friends within two weeks. I give out that advice to a lot of people, but I do not ever really listen to the advicec myself. Wow, I have like seven minutes left and my left hand is really starting to cramp up and it is getting harder and harder to type as each secong passes. I really wish that this would just end. When you are told to type about what is going on inside your head, you really have trouble. I usually do not have any trouble telling people about things I think about. . Oh my gosh this is so random, but last night around four in the morning or something like that, I woke up with a major cramp in my left calf. It hurt so incredibly bad. I tried walking, but I couldn't. It hurt so bad that I was crying until it went away. Even though it only lasted a short period of time, the time that it did last was torturous. Anyways, back to the analization of how I can not write when someone tells me too. I really wonder how people can take what a person writes and interpret it to mean something totally random. I just find that absolutely bizzare. I do not think that I would ever have that ability. I have two meetingts to go to tonight, and I do not know how I am going to do this, because they are both at the same times. Yay I am getting excited because I only have like two and a half minutes left to go. This really shows you how long twenty minutes is. I always thought that it was a really short time, but when you have to do something like this where you watch the time tick by, you are able to see that twenty minutes is a real long time. I really do not like Mondays and Wednesdays. I do not like the fact that I have classes in the morning and then I have a huge break, and then I have classes in the afternoon. We had open door night last night, and our room won cutest runner up. I do not know who won cutest overall, but we were happy with what we got. It is finally about to come to and end and my hands are in a lot of pain and will be relieved when they do not have to type anymore. Well less than thirty seconds and it is all over. I am way pumped over here.  \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"I really hope my parents let me get a motorcycle. It would be so much easier getting around campus if I had one, versus driving a car and having to park two miles away and walk the rest of the way in one hundred degree heat. I would be the perfect candidate for a motorcycle, I never speed, I don't have a single traffic violation and I have been driving for two years, I am a very defensive driver, and it is the perfect thing to get arounf in at U. t. If I do get a motorcycle I am going to get a Kawasaki Ninja ZX-6R, it is a perfect bike for me because it is not to big, but it is still just as fast as the larger displacement bikes. Practicality is a big plus, but it would also be nice to have a nice bike to drive around campus. I think I deserve the motorcycle because the rest of my friends all have very nice things and I am the highest achieving out of all of them, all my friends have brand new cars and trucks, but I got a super used old piece of junk. I know I am going to buy all the things I never had when I make a lt of money, which hopefully will be within a couple of years. A lot of people tell me that U. t. engineers, especially electrical engineers, which is what I am,can make very good money while they are still in college with internships and summer jobs. Or my parents would give me the money they had saved up for college if I could get a company to pay for the remainder of my college, by signing an agreement to work for them for a given amount of time. My electrical engineering mentor whom also is an honors student said he made six thousand dollars a month for the summer after his sophomore year. If I could make that much and I was still having fun, like I am now, I would stay and get my masters in either engineering or business, because if I could make fifty to seventy thousand a year my first year out of college, who knows how much I could make with an advanced degree. I would spend so much money on my parents to try to show how thankful I am for putting me in the position I am. I would also spoil myself as well, I would have the finest clothes, the fastest cars, and the most material things. I also enjoy the fact that after four years of electrical engineering I  should be a pretty intelligent person, whom hopefully capable of law shcool, grad school, or beyond.   \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='It is really really very very cold in my room. I do not know why they keep it so very cold in the dorm rooms. it is also cold in the dining hall. I am forced to wear my hoodie and always have a blanket on. I am glad I brought two blankets. sitting like this on my chair my foot is falling asleep. the chair is not so comfortable as a whole. josh has one of those big black comfy desk chairs that professional type people have it is the coolest thing ever. too bad he is a jerk eh. owww I just hit my knee on the stupid desk thing. I wish my roommate would come home she was supposed to be here like two hours ago. we are going out tonight which is good because all I have been doing the last couple days is studying which is necessary but it isn\\'t all that fun. I need to borrow duct tape so I can tape up the cords on the desk because they are ugly-looking. we were supposed to go to target sometime also, to buy a rug for the floor because the floor in this room is COLD. some of the classes on this campus are very far away from my dorm room. maybe I should figure out the whole bus system so I can take a bus down to them. although walking is good exercise and I do need exercise. you would think with an exercise room downstairs I would go down there and use it. maybe if my roommate does not come back by the time I am done this I will go work out for awhile. but then I will have to take another shower. don\\'t know if it is worth that. because then I will also have to dry my hair and I hate hair dryers. they are evil things. whoever decided that girls need to dry their hair in order to look good was an evil person. they never should have been invented. same with makeup. we should all just be completely natural. if somebody really, truly, likes you, they will like you all the same with no makeup on. at least that is my philosophy and I am sticking to it because I hate putting makeup on. it\\'s a pain. a waste of time, if  you will. the cd stopped. I should put another one on. now I\\'m going to have \\'yo\\'s a ho\\' stuck in my head. it\\'s not a bad song just not a song I would like to have stuck in my head. I always wake up in the morning with some random song stuck in my head. it\\'s weird. I don\\'t know where they come from. last night I had a dream that I was yelling at erin. in someone\\'s driveway- until she walked out on the street. I am unsure of what we were yelling about but I don\\'t think it would be that hard to get us to be yelling at each other. it\\'s really weird how easily one of your friends can turn hostile on you. I have an itch on my leg. it\\'s itchy. my hands are cold from typing, and because they are exposed to the cold that is my room. too bad there isn\\'t a thermostat type dealy in this room like some of the other dorm buildings have. I wish I were staying in blanton I would like to be able to go to the lobby and hang out whenever I felt like it like people do there all the time. the only time people around here hang out is just when they are studying. I guess I could go knock on some random people\\'s doors and watch tv with them or something. meh. I can\\'t believe lela\\'s dorm has a curfew. that\\'s crazy. at first I thought she was talking about visiting hours, because we have visiting hours at eleven thirty sunday through thursday, but she was actually talking about a curfew. they have to be in the building by eleven. I guess they know who is in by who swipes their card. that is like big brother or something. 1984. I don\\'t like it. I mean, these people are all almost 18 years old. and they are Church of Christ - going people. if they stay out past eleven or twelve, they are most likely not going to do something bad. and if they do, I think that is their problem. not the dorms\\'. I definitely could not live like that. I don\\'t even like visiting hours. my hands are still cold. half the point of going to college is having more freedom. if I only wanted to take classes I would stay at home and live with my parents. but I wanted more freedom (and also to meet new people and have fun) so I guess that is what I have to do. it\\'s a shame I am terrible at meeting new people. and they are bad at meeting me. it doesn\\'t help that my psychology class has 550 + people in it. it\\'s a bit insane when you have a class that is only 30 people short of your graduating class. and they all fit in one room. our class couldn\\'t fit in one room for the longest time, until they built the new auditorium. my brother\\'s class has a thousand in it, but they are really bad so I wonder how many they will have when he graduates. BRRRR my hands are cold. the cushion thing on the chair keeps sliding around and it is really quiet in here. I need to talk to my suitemates more. they seem nice but we don\\'t ever talk to them it\\'s really a shame. I need to clean the water filter pitcher so I can drink some water. water is good stuff. josh says some girl he knows drinks 3 glasses of coffee a day. I don\\'t drink any caffeine. I did one day and I was jittery and nervous and bouncing off the walls and stuff. it was not enjoyable. my mom drinks coffee everyday. I don\\'t understand why people think they need it. is it psychological? or do they really need it to wake up?  on tv people always say lets go get coffee\" or \"we need some coffee\" and it\\'s always after some traumatic event or really late at night. I think that drinking coffee then would make things worse. what you would need is some sleep, and caffeine would not help sleep. it would keep you awake. at least it keeps me awake. I guess some people can sleep even though they have caffeine in them? I wonder why andy called this morning. I called him back twice and he didn\\'t answer either time. weird. people are weird. all of them. especially james. with his bald head. it does not make any sense to me why he took a year off from the core. he seemed to have loved it and his excuse of \"I am a. d. d. \" doesn\\'t really make all that much sense. because. the core is so disciplined. I would think it would be good for a person who had a. d. d. I wonder if there is a another period if you end a sentence with an abbreviated word. that would look really funny. like 2/3 of a \". \"  well I am going to end this the way I started it. it is really really very very cold in here.

       " Document(page_content=\"This seems kind of odd to sit and write to a complete stranger. I wonder if i should try to be grammatically correct, if I should capitalize my letters. Normally my mind is very poetic in it's way of thining. I can walk around daily thinking of poems, constantly creating poetry out of the world. Then there's the side of me that is analytical, am I typing too much? Why am I talking to myself? Damn a minute is a long time? There are always questions. I've always had a fascination with animals, this in turn make me grow way too fond of my pets. I believe it's personally healthy for me, but it is controversial. . (no i do not do vulgar things with my dog). I have a weenie dog, and she is the best thing that has ever happened to me. I got her when i was really sad and it is her that lifts me up. The breed itself is funny, their length is their personality. It is also amusing that I, a man hating lesbian, have a weenie dog. My room is really hot right now, i'm here thinking of leaving, not sleeping; I already sleep too much. You would think it takes longer than five minutes to think this much but oh well. I feel like i'm talking to myself but it's odd to know that someone will read this. What happens if someone says they will kill themselves. do you shrug it off, or do you intervene? I think i would like a job were i just sit and read peoples thoughts, i think maybe 20 minutes might be too long but it's not a big deal. It's like i'm turning paranoid, i'm starting to think of things to write, like my outfit or my hands, almost like when your senses are on high and you have acute hearing and taste and smell and touch. That's when you are precise, you know what you are talking about. There is alot of dissapointment in the senses. Our mind has such an imagination that we are often dissapointed by what it really feels like or something such as that. I also wonder what this expiriment is for. What is it that you are trying to get out of me? My age you know, my life you never will so what's up your cranium?  That's a funny thing to say. My mind is slowing down and i don't have that much to say. i don't really think i can do this continous thing.  Is it ok if i pause a few times. It's weird the things people are worried about, like what could you possibly do to me if i said vulgar things to you on this assignment. I watched a good movie yesterday, it had a cheater in it, something I now can relate to. It's not good to feel that, never will be most likely (unless jealousy ignites your desires). I only wish I never do that to anyone, for I know how it feels and it is from that that I do not want to hurt people. but i know i might not be strong enough to substain. so i leave my door open to things, to everything and i wonder now that it's the end of my time wether or not it automatically cuts you off at 20 minutes or can you finish your sentence. I guess that is just a common worry, but if it's not maybe i'm just paranoid.    \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"     Just as i moved to this page my roomate came into our apartment and it appears that he has brought some food back from the grocery store. That is always a good thing. Now I'm thinking about how I can possibilly type my thoughts for this amount of time with out taking a break for some snacks and whatnot. Today has felt like the longest day that I can remember and I can't figure out why. When I was in my math class at 11 in the morning I for some reason it felt to me as if it was 5 in the evening. Now I am listening to the tv in the background and amthinking about how much I disagree with the news man. What is going to be typed by me in 5 minutes from now is flooding me with curiosity. I hope that this week goes by much faster then it is right now. I can't wait until Texas plays North Carolina this Saturday. Horns football is one of the top three reasons why I applied to The University of Texas and I am very glad that I got in. Now I am looking at a picture of the roadrunner from wiley cyotte however you spell it and it makes me think of apples and oragnges. That kind of scares me that random things like that just kind of pop up into my head, but oh well. Now I am wishing that I had started some music to play as a was writing this because I am almost always interested in listening to music. Yes my roomate is talking to me and he didnt know that I was home this entire time what a silly bastard. Now I am listening to Whiteny Houston who is a supposed crack head butthat doesn't really bother me because she can sing ok. I wonder how many times she does crack cocaine a day or use too. Sometimes I wonder what it feels like to be high on coke but I have never tried it. The reasons I haven't done coke is probably because most people I know that do coke are lost causes. My roomate thinks I'm an alcoholic because he heard me say I was drinking punch and I am but he thought it was trashcan punch which means his mind was on alcohol so maybe he is the alcoholic. I am not excited about having to go to three classes today because I am so very tired that I could easily take a nap and enjoy it a 100 times more. I have about 4. 25 minutes left, that makes me think about how much faster this writing assignment has gone thean I thought it would. What my life will be like 8 months from now is a random thought that just entered my mind. I wonder if I will still have my girlfriend, and I hope I do and I wonder if I will be less depressed than I am right now because at the moment I am at a time where very little makes me happy and I really didn't have that problem at all over the summer unless I was thinking about school again. I don't know exactly why but school changes my state of mind dramatically and quickly. I know I should be thankful to even go to school but how can I help the feelings that I have. now there are three two oh times up. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"You know I always wonder if I'm ever doing the right thing in life by coming to this university and not going somewhere else. I had opportunities to go to other universities but I chose to stay close to home. My parents always want it there way! They basically chose my major for me and when I wanted to change it, they became upset and really didn't want to see my face which made me upset. I want to do what my parents tell me to do but if it does not interest me and I know I'm going to stress over it, why should I bother to listen and I went with what I felt was best for me and I made the change. I always wonder how some people are so intelligent and others try so much but can't reach the level of that intelligent person based on academics. I see people trying so hard to make that A in that one class where the intelligent person doesn't take one ounce of effort to even study and this person would make a higher grade on the exam then the person who tried so hard to learn the material and study so hard on the exam. One thing which confuses me is how girls think. They're like in their own world sometimes. You try to be so nice to them sometimes and they look at you like you're the biggest IDIOT! I wish they would open up more around guys and not just talk with their girlfriends all the time. They should be able to tell their guy friends anything they tell their girlfriends. Why do the Astros suck so bad this year? They had a perfect baseball team and they're playing like a bunch of high school boys. They were recognized as favorites this season and they're ranked last in the division. They're is no excuse for being so mad especially a team so talented like the Astros. I mean if you had Bagwell, Biggio, Alou, Caminitti and other stars, wouldn't you expect your team to be good?? The rockets need to do better next year also. I can't believe they didn't pick up any free agents this summer. They could have really improved this year with all the talented free agents and they made the mistake of not picking up anyone. If they want to be really good again, they're going to have to pick up some talented free agents or they're not going anywhere and even in danger of not making the playoffs. I don't know why some teachers just don't tell us what will be on the exam. It would be so much easier to study the material but NO, they make us study everything even the non important information which really pisses of students, especially me. One thing I really love in the University are the girls. They are so damn hot! Only if I could have one of them would I show them what kind of man I really am!

I stair at my fish, and don't know many of my neighbors since I am new to the Austin area. My room is a mess, I am a total slob and hate to admit that. However, I would clean it up if I had a guest or to. But not during the week me and my friends are busy doing homework and trying to inteact with orginizations around the UT campus. I still miss my dance at Blinn. I worked so hard for that team and myself finally made friends in that little town. I am happy to be at a new school though for a new fresh start. Tryouts for the UT dance team are on thursday and I am debating back and forth if I will make it and how bad I really want it. I know for a fact I really want that spot on the dance team it would be a complete honor. But then again I have this attitude that if I don't care the dissapointment will not hurt as bad if I don't get the spot. I am just so use to being on a dance team and belonging to a group. Everyone knows me as the dancer. so what am I now if I don't make the dance team?  I actually miss home its been about a month and a half since I have seen my parents and I miss my 2 cats soo bad!  I miss my ex boyfriend terribly and wish I could see although he is 3 and 1/2 hrs away at Sam Houston University. I miss those hugs he would give everyday even when we were friends they honestly made me feel good inside. I am acutally quite bothered that my boyfriend won't call me back. I haven't seen him in 3 days and just wanted to see him for a little while. Everytime I ask him if I can see him and have to ask still after 5 months of going out he always answers with a I don't know. I feel like I need a lot of attention and hurts my feelings when he seriously does that. Not allowed to hang out with my best guy friend because these two don't get along however I don't agree with that and hang out with him anyways. I don't feel as I have to clear everything with him. I am happy that I have my two best friends here though quite close on campus. One my bestfriend from highschool didn't see much of eachother there for a while because I went away to school for 2 years and she stayed home. Alice and me have been roomates for 2 years in a tiny dorm room and decided that we wanted to live by ourselves for a change. I actually enjoy it and can do as I please. I am aslo worried about finding study buddys for my classes because I am sure my grades will be better if I study with others. Its hard to just start talking to people. when I am new I can be a bit shy. But once you get to know me I am a quite talkative person full of energy but people don't know that unless they approach me. I need to dye my hair red again becuase my mousy brown hair is starting to show again and I hate it. . glad I don't have to go to work today becaue i have soo much to do this week. I should really clean up my apartment because I have a major ant problem going on here especially in the kitchen. Its one of my best friends birthday's today I called her up and shes going out tonight wish I was here but I'm not in Houston. Wish I could be home. My dad just lost his job but has been wanting to leave for awhile. And does have a back up he has his own business called    Inland Homes  . Now I am glad he can dedicate all he can to his dreams which is having a successful business of his own. I am worried about him though he has been very stressed out latley. I need to call T.

I just wish that the first time would be enough. But for me it isn't. I wish that some times I was as smart as some people I know. the load of school is really beginning to weigh me down. I guess you guys will label that as stress. I always feel that I AM being constantly studied in psy. I always wonder what that would when I do a certain thing or think a certain thought. I really enjoy the class but I am way behind. I have a lot of reading to do in that class . I have alot of catching up to do. Especially in that class I am way behind on the chapters. I just want to have some time to do the things I want to do. I want to go an play basketball and lacrosse or just watch TV. I just want to relax and have fun . Studying sucks.

Man the moving is getting good but I don't want to tell my roommate to turn it off. I like it to o so I wouldn't to turn it off either.

I am also excited about the football game this week when we sit on the 40 in row 5. That's sweet. I think this is taking so long. you guy's should make this 15 or 10 minutes long next time. too bad we couldn't do that for the other two due in December. I am two shy to ask the Prof. in class, maybe after class or before. He'll probably laugh in my face when I suggest it. The last four minutes are taking too damn long I just want to finish and do something else. I want to watch the movie and not study. Studying blows. I wish things were a hell of alot easier. the clock is going to slow. I am sick of writing. this is taking too long to finish. I want to do something else than this poop. the writing is getting very boring. there is another good part of the movie coming up. the movie is pretty good and I have to do this crap. there it went the best part and I missed it because of this crap.

       " Document(page_content='I am sitting in my room and I look around to see my roommate and my boyfriend. Trying to make my train of thought come to me so I can type it. All I can think about is all my boyfriend\\'s theories about life and his many different issues. He believes in \"Boxism\", he was a little out of it when he thought of this, were everyone was born in a box which was placed in a bigger box, hospital room, which is part of a bigger box, the hospital hall, which is placed into a bigger box, the whole hospital building itself. Then he goes on to state that we are then taken home and put in a box, the crib, which is in a box the room, part of the bigger box the whole house. After this we go to school and the classroom becomes our box after we graduate we our placed in our dorm room box and walk from class to class or box to box. After we finally manage to get a job our cubicle or office which then becomes our box. Then he goes on that when we die they dig a box and put you into a box. My boyfriend\\'s theory always brings a smile to my face as I remember when he first told me this. Wow, that only took me ten minutes. I look around my room and see all my pictures and think about going back to high school, I believe that those are some of the best times in my life. My class was very small and we all got to know each other very well. I have always been told that college is the best time of you life but it will take a lot to compete with high school. I hope it becomes the best time of my life. I have already come to enjoy it and have become adapted to college life. I love being able to do whatever I want when I want to. I hope these next few years will become the best years of my life.  '),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Just like everyone else\\'s writings, I\\'m sure starting off with I don\\'t know what to write is commonplace. we used to have to write like this in english last year but Mrs. williams would give us a specific topic- like \"king kong\" or \"umbrellas\". she was the coolest teacher, she really had a good time teaching our class and made sure we had a good time too. a lot of the guys took advantage of her good nature though, especially when we had to do the \"hobbitt\" project and austin named one of the characters \"dildo daggins\". that was interesting because Mrs. williams couldn\\'t really hear them say \"dildo\" and wondered why the class was laughing so hard. I wasn\\'t in that class but I got to hear all about it. I really miss all those guys, we had a pretty close group of friends because we all grew up together and went to pretty much all the same schools together. by graduation there were about 7 of us that had gone through school together since pre-k. I think that says a lot about us. there are others that I\\'ve gone to school with since elementary school too since we were all in the same advanced classes. this annoying \"firewall alert\" keeps popping up on my screen and it\\'s bugging the fire out of me cause I don\\'t like computers to begin with and I can\\'t get it to stop. kinda like our smoke detector. it beeped for 4 days before someone would come to change it. my roommate went out of town this weekend and when she got back and came in the room she said \"is that thing STILL beeping?\" and she told me it had been beeping for 2 days and she kept forgetting to report it. so I went downstairs to report it and they told me no one would come until at least Monday because the maintenance crew doesn\\'t work on the weekends. it really sucks cause I couldn\\'t study or sleep in here because the thing beeped every 45 seconds. I ended up staying at towers with my guy friends from high school and we had a really good time- so I guess it worked out. I think I\\'m going to start dating their third roommate- he is from san antonio and I\\'ve really gotten to know him the past couple of weeks cause I\\'m always at my guy friends\\' place. oh yah- and the maintenance guy finally came today and fixed the smoke detector. I don\\'t know where my roommate is, she left at 5:30 for her sorority meeting and I left for mine at 6 but she is still not back and it\\'s almost 9. my dad called today and wants me to go to my grandparents sometime soon and shut off the hot water heater. my grandparents have been traveling in colorado since the beginning of july and when my parents came to move me in they stayed out at my grandparents (in south austin) and forgot to turn off the hot water heater. I don\\'t understand why he wants me to do it- he could call their neighbors, which would be a lot more convenient (sp?) for me since I don\\'t have a car. I called two of my friends to see if I could borrow their car but neither one of them picked up the phone, so maybe my roommate will take me out there later. I wish I could drive her car but it\\'s a standard and I\\'m not very good at them. I got my nose re-pierced last night, chasity (my roommate) went with me. I got it done when I was in Ecuador this summer for a dollar and here they wanted $30! I wanted to scream. but oh well- it\\'ll be there for a while. I took it out when I got home from ecuador because I didn\\'t know how my parents would feel about it, and I know my dad\\'s parents would shit bricks if they saw it, so I decided to play it cool and take it out when I was around my parents or grandparents, but it became too much of a hassle and I left it out too long. I really like it though- the stud it a tiny light blue rhinestone. I have a white one I got while I was in ecuador that I\\'m going to change out pretty soon. my roommate has her nose pierced too. I can\\'t wait to show my brother. I called him last night to tell him and he was kinda mad that I did it without him because I had told him that I\\'d get it done before I left for college and that he could go with me but it just never happened. it\\'s a big thing in Chile from girls to have their nose pierced and while we were in Ecuador a youth group of about 20 came up from Chile. I really miss Ecuador- I can\\'t wait to go back, even though I don\\'t speak the language very well I made a lot of great relationships. this one guy, dandle, from Chile, really had an impact on me. we still talk through e-mail daily and it\\'s awesome to see things from his perspective. he is the person I\\'d most like to see again. he taught himself to speak English- he is never had a formal English lesson, and he wants to be a youth minister or music minister. I\\'m so impressed by his faith and his determination to educate himself. I really wish I had that mindset and determination to better myself without the help of teachers and tutors and school- but there are so many opportunities here that make it easier to get help I suppose. the time\\'s almost up- I really didn\\'t think I\\'d be able to type and think for 20 minutes but it\\'s kinda flown by in a hurry- bye!

       " Document(page_content=\"I don't know if I'm still mad at my friend. I hope she never does it again but somehow I think it'll take longer for her to change. Should I leave her alone or still hang out with her?  I'm getting tired of taking care of everyone. I don't know whether I want to go clubbing or go home this weekend. I sort of want to go home and get more food because I'm getting tired of the american food here. I don't hate olivia and I think its stupid that all these people hate her for no other reason than other people hating her. I think its very immature and you should get to know a person before judging her. I'm worried about my friend who is always taking drugs and she thinks its really cool. I had a writing assignment like this in high school. My psychology teacher in high school was so boring because she had a monotonous voice and she . I don't know but is very strange. I miss my high school life but I still prefer my college life. In high school everything seems controlled because my parents placed restrictions on my life but now here, its different because there is no one to control me. I sort of like this new freedom because my parents were really strict at home. I never got to stay out late but now, I could do whatever I want. I'm just afraid that I might mess up my schoolwork here at college. I don't want to mess up because I want a bright future but then I also want to experience and have fun my college years. So I have to learn how to set priorities to my life. I miss my high school life and I know that I could never go back to it. But I feel like I have truly lived my senior year of high school. High school was fun because I made friends I know I would keep for a lifetime. They are the ones I would call up if I'm upset or the ones I don't mind crying to. But in college, I feel like, no one really gives a damn about you unless you had some history with them. My classmates here, we're all in competition and the only ones I could turn to for now are the friends I had in high school. I just feel more comfortable being around them because I know that they've seen me through a lot of situations. I wish I could make more friends here at UT because its such a big campus and I want to be well connected. So I have started going to CBS and that's helping a lot I think not only because I meet people there but also it calms me down. Because thurs night I went clubbing and after that I still felt wild but now I'm ready to settle down and work hard in college. I don't want any regrets. I wish I could also find a boyfriend here at UT so I have someone I could rely or depend on. Because I'm tired of being depended on all the time. The ideal kind of guy would probably be a guy younger than me I would totally go for him. I wish it was summer, I like this UT campus because it just feels like home. It fits, because at home I'm always counting the days until I left home but now that I'm at uT I'm enjoying my days here. I don't usually like writing stuff like this because sometimes I feel like its a waste of time. I rather talk it out to someone so they can endure the pain of listening as well. Does someone actually read this?  Because this would be a lot of reading to do. not only to read my writing but also to read everyone's elses writing. What is the purpose of this writing?  I'm almost done, five more minutes of just rambling. This is like xanga. Everyone on there just rambles on forever about their day and their thoughts. Do they feel any different after they finish writing?  Well. xanga's are interesting to read when I'm bored but I don't think I would ever have one just because I don't want to waste my time on that and that I don't want to post up my personal life. I'm running out of stuff to say, I have never consider myself to be a very talkative person. Even to other people. I wish my roommate would get her internet port fixed because I'm tired of her always having to use my computer when she does something. Even if it was for schoolwork, I'm really anal about people touching my computer. Should I go and help her yell at the people who fixes computers because I want her to get it fixed now but she just seems to drag it. Is that selfish of me?  Well. I'm again running out of stuff to say and I have approx one more minute. My goals for college is to succeed I don't want to fail because its so much harder to climb back up again once you fall. Yay. almost time. 30 more sec. blah blah    20 more sec    I feel like an idiot just rambling here. \"),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"Well, I am wondering if I had read the instructions as carefully as I could have. The timer at the stop was unexpected. Convenient though. Although, I had planned to just look at my roommate's clock radio. It is reading 10:02. I am working on my day planner trying to figure out where my free time is going. College is different from what I expected it to be. I'm not sure what is worse knowing no one or knowing 7 people out of 10,000 undergraduates and wondering if I will see someone I know today. It could be worse. I need to try to call my aunt today. I tried yesterday, but she was not there and I really didn't want to leave a message. I really don't know my family in Austin as well as I should. I wish I could go up to Ohio and see how cousins are doing up there. I have no idea where my roommate is. This is the 3 day he has not returned from wherever he goes. It is funny when I think about it. I wake up try not to make any noise then I realize I am the only one in the room. It is exciting as it is lonely. Maybe I'll do laundry today or something. I can't believe I actually like going to my classes. Perhaps it is because I do not have anywhere else to go. Human contact is everywhere, but I just want to feel welcomed outside of a classroom atmosphere. Matchbox Twenty's Unwell just finished playing on the radio. The Oh Baby song just came on. I am amazed at what passes for music sometimes. Hip hop is not music. Rap is a joke. They don't even make sense, they just try to rhyme their words with the next line. I liked Will Smith as a rapper, but I don't think he does it anymore. Clean rap is a thing of the past. Once it stood for something now it has shifted to image and jewelry. Sad. I am feeling a little tired. I have been sleeping very well, but sometimes I forget where I am. A moment of panic surrounds me then I realize where I am. 4 walls, 4 plain walls can be intimidating to wake up to everyday. I can't wait until we get those message boards up. Maybe we can add some character to this room. I am getting thirsty know. This dormitory is secluded, but it is alright unless I need to get something to eat or drink. I am not going to use all my Bevo Bucks on vending machines. From what I heard, they go fast while dine in dollars linger on and on. At least I am not in Jester. Almost done. Now what should I write about? \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Here it goes. 20 minutes seems like a long time but I don\\'t have to think really. Wait, that is the whole purpose. Think, Think, Think. The game my roommate plays all the time distracts me from studying but I would never say anything. Just let it be, let it be, whisper words of wisdom, let it be. Well, I see the football schedule on my desk and it reminds me that a girl from home may be coming up this weekend. Hopefully I can get her a ticket to the game. Maybe I will make a sign and put it by the elevator that say that I will buy a ticket for, lets say, $10. I think that should work. Ever since I came here I have been having trouble keeping the stupid elastic sheet on the mattress. It always comes off. It really annoyed me, I mean really annoying. So, when I went home this weekend I bought these straps that hold the sheet to the mattress. I have installed them and could not be more pleased. I have beat the mattress! Victory is mine! Its interesting that I can see all of my class buildings from my dorm room window. Pretty decent view. Tonight, I worry that I am too behind in my classes. Yet, I can\\'t imagine that everyone in the class is. I mean, I do a pretty decent amount of work. I bet I am about equal with most students. The part that has me worried is that all of my professors say that most people make Cs in there class. That is just not acceptable. I have to go graduate school. How hard is it to go to graduate school? I really don\\'t know. I can\\'t be that hard. Or is it? 11 more minutes what to talk about. My suitemate just started the shower. I can hear the water running. I also hear the gun shots from that game my roommate always plays. Pow, Pow, Pow. That must be fun. I, however, am trapped in this writing screen. Write, Write, Write. Like a machine. Now I hear jazz music. I\\'ve never really met anyone who like jazz music. This kind of reminds me of Catcher in the Rye. Maybe Holden Caulfield was just a steam of consciousness. I wish I had a hunters cap to put on. Maybe I could go to the pond and see if the damn ducks were still there. Where do they go in the winter, anyway? Does someone come in a van and take them away to a zoo or something. Or do they just fly away, fly away. Ah! I\\'ve received an instant message. I can\\'t read it yet. Must type, type, type. 6 minutes left, almost there. Nope, that is still a long time. I just noticed my rubik\\'s cube. One side is completed, the others? You guessed it, INCOMPLETE. Maybe one day I will finish it. Ok, now my hands are beginning to tire. 4 and a half minutes left. Just keep typing. My neck hurts too. This is making me sleepy. I really want to go to sleep after this. Ah, that would be nice. BUT NO, I have to read. Lots of reading actually. In fact, psychology, 1 chapter. Pow, Pow, Pow. He says, Missed the head. \" What does that mean? Head makes me think of beer. That lager has a good, hearty head. Nice, only 1 and a half minutes left.

       " Document(page_content=\"The one thing that amazes me the most is the  complexity of the female mind. At one point, you think you know exactly what they want, but as soon as you can comfortably assume that, it all gets twisted around and kicks you in the ass. Also, when you are on the flip side of goodbye, you really start to understand the importance of relationships. If you are always on the winning team, you don't know what it would be like to lose. The more you win, the more you will think yourself invincible until you are brought down, and then you feel the most devastating emotion you have ever felt. The only difference is that with relationships, you never think about losing, especially if youre on a winning streak. True, some people will never have to experience being on the heartbreaking side of goodbye, but if you keep playing the game, eventually you will lose. No matter how much success you have after your loss, even if it is a bigger victory, you will always remember the loss you experienced and try to figure it out. I've found myself racking my brain to try and figure out something that I will ever be able to understand. The saying that time will heal all wounds is a load of crap. Time only allows wounds to fester and become infected. I think that relationships are more like getting drunk more than anything else. The more you drink it in, the better it feels. You know that the feeling won't last forever, but you keep doing it anyway, always hoping. Then it ends, and all hell breaks loose in your head. Reality hits you because you have nothing to swing back at it. The only way to lessen the pain is to start working on the next round. The old pain is still there, but youve managed to cover it up with something that will eventually add to the old pain. It may seem that i'm depressed, but in reality i just try to figure things out, and if i cant, i find similarities between two things that i can't understand. Somehow it feels like i've found a solution that way. That or it seems less pathetic.     It's odd that when youre young, you always think that you'll be different from the stereotypes when you get older. When I was little, i always used to wonder why musicians would include foul language and sexual references in their records. My parents didn't like the subjects of many of the songs that I listened to, so I always told myself that if I ever became a musician, I would never include those kind of things in my songs. However, now it is apparent to me (through personal experience) that these things are boosters in the audience's attention span. However, I wonder if standards have changed, especially since the dawn of Eminem. I also think that people overreact to his music. He is simply writing about what he knows and how he feels, which is what i really respect in a musician. \"),\n",

I can't wait, I want some pretzel and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. and some fruit, definitely a banana. I'm worried that the peanut butter is going to make me fat. I'm not used to the food here, even thought I don't really look fat, I feel a little fatter, but I'm not eating bad junk food, just normal food, but its not like the food from home. plus I'm not getting as much exercise here, its just so hard to fit everything in, and I'm not in a schedule yet, I hate that. but I really want to be more easy going. school I scaring me right now, I'm worried because we have not had any tests yet so I don't really know what any of them are going to be like, so I don't know how I will do, and I'm not at all used to doing bad, I always get high a's and I don't know if that will happen here. I hope a good song comes on now that one finally ended! so anyways I'm really really freaked out because my hair is falling out. like I sit here and . wait I love this song! I want to turn it up. anyways I think its because of all the stress I'm under. this happened to me earlier this summer and then I winced I finally relaxed it stopped, but its like a chain reaction because I get stressed and worried so my hair falls out and then once I see my hair falling out I get even more stressed and worried because it always looks so bad in a pony tail and when its down it just never looks good any more and it makes me feel ugly so that stress me out more and I continue to worry and it just does not stop. last week was really hard but this week I think I'm more used to everything so hopefully I will stop stressing so much because its not really doing me any good, I just want to have so much fun at college and I totally am.

I really need more sleep I just took a 20minute nap in between my two last classes it was great I love feeling so refreshed I felt like I slept for hours. why can't I feel that good in the morning? ewww that morning that makes me think of the disgusting yogurt they had in the cafeteria, first it was not mixed. like I could see gross water in it so I mixed it and then it was plain,. who serves plain yogurt. op I'm hungry again. and know I have to go to the bathroom. I hope I get used to community bath soon because its so weird like just uncomfortable I don't want to listen to other girls going to the restroom lol. o well I'm sure ill get over it its only the 3rd week but it feels like I have been here forever I love it so much freedom and I can do anything I want it will be so weird going home next summer. next summer we already have to be renting apartments for next year its way to early I have only lived here for 3 weeks I hope I get good roommates and live in a fun complex like either the new new villas or the new boardwalk that would be crazy fun,, maybe a little too much fun lol I hope I'd be able to get my work done o well I can't wait to have so much fun.

From this point forward I strive to be the best that I can be in school and whatever I do so that I can get into a medical school, hopefully somewhere in Texas. I grew up and lived most of my childhood in dallas texas and that is where my dad lives. I have a lot of friends that live there and I really like dallas. It holds  a special place I my heart because of all of my experiences there. I moved to mIdland texas in the seventh grade and went to high school there at midland high. it is really neat to hear you talk about midland, Dr. Pennebaker, in our class. I had many great thigns happen to me while I was in midland and one of those things is my long term girlfriend of five years, Katy Kelly. She means the world to me and I  hope I mean the  world to her. She ended up at texas tech university but hopefully she is going to transfer to UT at the start of next school year for the fall of 2000. I am going to las vegas with her and her family in september for her birthday and I think that will be fun. it will be hot in las vegas and I look forward to seeing the beachboys and Alannis Morisette live at my hotel. I miss her terribly and I haven't seen her since the 20 of August. her mom and dad constantly send me email and little care packages and I hope someday I will marry this girl. I want to live somewhere in the country but somewhere that I don't have to drive that far to work. I want to live outside of a big city because I want to be a weell known doctor that people from all over teh country go to in order to get there bones fixed. that has always been a goal of mine and I plan to carry it out. I hope to have kids someday and raise them the same  way my dad raised me because I can't complain. I grew up in a chrch going family and just came to really know the Lord abotu two years ago. Church is very important to me although I havent found a church here in Austin that I am just wild about. I am a freshman yousee and I havenot been heree that long. that is my life story wrapped up in just a little bit of time but I guess that was my stream of conciousness because that is what I thought about when I was writing. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Well, I\\'m not exactly sure what to write about. I just finished my prescreening for the Psychology Experiment stuff and I now have to 1. 5 credits for it. So I only have to get 3. 5 more I guess to get the 5. I hope the experiment things aren\\'t anything to bad and they don\\'t take that long. I hate typing when I have rings and bracelets on. I really like to wear jewelry but they just start to hurt me when they rub up against the keyboard holder thingy. I don\\'t know how I\\'m going to be able to write straight for 20 minutes. I just took my bracelet off, it was really hurting. I have so much homework to do this weekend. I guess teachers (professors) think that since it\\'s a long weekend we shoudl have time to do all kinds of stuff so they give us more work. I guess the professors don\\'t realize that each teacher gives us more and we would like to have some free time too. I also have to go to all kinds of places this weekend. I have to go to Dallas to see my half sister because she\\'s in the hospital for something, I really don\\'t want to go though. We never talk anymore and why should I go see her when she can\\'t even call me when she promises to. Oh, I met these friends at UT. They are so great. One of them really. Her name is Sarah and she\\'s really nice. I think we might try to get an apartment together next year so we can live together and not have to put up with stupid roommates like the one I have this year. She lied to me about everything and I think she might be doing some kind of drugs or something. The other day I heard her talking to some friends about sniffing some kind of chemicals in some guy\\'s dorm. I don\\'t know what they were talking about, that is just what I heard. Carol is talking about Sarah right now to my dad while my mom is sleeping. She thinks Sarah is so cool. I wonder if what I eat is actually eating a lot or if I\\'m just eating a normal amount of food. I try to eat 3 meals a day even though the food isn\\'t always great. Oh, Kinsolving isn\\'t all that great. Some of the food is good, but I can\\'t stand eating there every day. They need to have food on this campus other than chicken. I love chicken and I used to want it all the time, but now since I\\'ve been here I\\'ve been dying for beef. The other day I was so stupid. I was talking to Carol on the phone and I said, \"I\\'m tired, but I don\\'t want to lay down. I\\'m bored but I don\\'t want to do anything. I\\'m not hungry, but I\\'m dying for meat. \"  I bet I sounded so stupid. I drove home today from Austin. I really didn\\'t want to becuase I haven\\'t drove anywhere in like a month, but I really need to start driving again. I can\\'t wait till I get to go to Casa Ole again. I can\\'t believe Austin doesn\\'t have them here. That is like the stupidest thing in the world. I take that back. The stupidest thing in the world is that UT doesn\\'t sell Dr. Pepper anywhere!  How can they do that!  If you ask any person our age what soft drink they would prefer, the majority of them would say that they like Dr. Pepper the best. My mom just woke up. I finally found one places on campus that has it though. The Union has Dr. Pepper at the Taco Bell. I haven\\'t checked anywhere else yet. My dad is talking about this guy\\'s truck that got stolen today. I can\\'t believe that happened. They live in a pretty good part of town and nothing like that ever happens here. My dogs are fighting. I have two dogs, Milo and Brewser. Milo is a red beagle that is Brewser\\'s son and he turned a year old May 15, 2004. Brewser is a black beagle that turns 11 on October 11, 2004. It\\'s weird to think of their age. Milo is really crazy and Brewser is really calm. It probably is because he is so old though. I felt so stupid today in Biology. We had to work in these small groups and figure out these questions the teacher told us to do and for the first question, I sort of knew the answer but I didn\\'t have it completely right. The second question was to figure out the hypothesis out of a group of statements but it was hard. When I was in high school we were always told to write a hypothesis in \"If, Then\" form. Meaning that this would be an example, \"IF we put this together, THEN this should happen. \"  In this class though, its just a statement. No ifs. No thens. No questions. It just made me feel stupid cause I could pick the hypothesis out of the group. There there was the last question that she asked and I had no clue about it. All that really scared me though because I am afraid of not making it in Austin here at UT. Out of my high school we had 106 seniors. Out of those 106 there were 59 that went to college or went to some trade school or ARMY. Out of those 59, 35 went to aTm. I can\\'t get over that. Only 2 of us came to UT and that is me and my ex boyfriend, Nathan. I am afraid of what all my aTm \"friends\" would say if I couldn\\'t make it here. I really don\\'t know what to talk about. I keep making all these stupid noises just because I can\\'t think of what to say. My sister is now watching Who Wants to be a Millionaire and my dad just ate some M&Ms. My mom is out feeding Milo and Brewser. Oh, Milo is actually mine. I was too young for Brewser to actually be mine so he is actually my mom and dad\\'s. Carol has a dog, ferret, and fish at her house in Temple. The dog\\'s name is Bart. Carol is laughing at me because she is reading what I am writing and she thinks this is the stupidest assignment in the world. I have to say, that since I\\'ve been writing it, I have to agree. I think it\\'s kind of cool, but I really don\\'t see the point in having to write this all out. Well, I understand that it is cool to see how the mind thinks and how our brain processes information, but this sort of seems like a waste of time. Oh, well. I\\'m getting credit for it. Oh, I might get to go to my first concert pretty soon. I\\'m going to try to get to tickets to the Austin City Limits thing. Sarah and Gabby were telling me about it and while I was in class today they tried to go get tickets. Gabby got one but while Sarah was in line, they cut everybody off like 3 people in front of her.

       " Document(page_content=\"at this point I am very unsure of what exactly to do or where my direction for the future is. My paranoia that I developed from living in ny has certainly overcome my life as everyday is almost a struggle at times to go on because I so easily find something to mess it up. I feel as if everything is always ready to go wrong, so I guess I need a more optimistic view of my life so I don't have to have negative beliefs everyday that ruin a perfect day.  I guess I am also questioning whether I belong in Austin or if I should return to NYC and transfer to nyu business school. I will need a 4. 0 both semesters which will be close to impossible for myself in order to stay here. in addition I also wonder if I belong here and if I can fit in with everyone else. they are all nice to me but I just wonder if I can fit in and if they are all being fake to me behind my back, not that I don't already have to deal with that in ny. if it were not for people I could trust like Reid or Jason or a very few others than I don't think I could make it here. I am very surprised to find how certain people have just drifted away and its like I make an effort and they don't even care about it. I just feel that sometimes things are not any better here than in ny and if it came down to the two I would probably just go back to NYC.   NYC has a very special importance to me. I feel in a weird way that I can fit in there and it is my real home. to have the opportunity to live there for college and party all the time is really exciting, although I wonder if it would be the right choice to go back east since I was so miserable there. Danielle is the only person who I can count on and maybe even Nicole if I was not so pissed at her for going out with mike, but then again maybe that is my fault. if I wasn't so flirty and actually expressed my feelings than maybe it could have worked a lot better, but then again I always find someway to screw things up as usual which always haunts me at every task or thing now because I go in with such a negative attitude all the time. hopefully I can have another positive year like last time and it will help me be more confident. In the mean time I really need to focus on new goals and establish myself more positively:       1. get a 4. 0 average so I have the opportunity to stay if I want to but keep all transfers in mind especially nyu or something in the Boston area in case I feel the need to leave.    2. keep working out and getting big - competition is tough and I have to compete with you know who so I feel as if I must keep on going and hopefully it will work and I will look decent for once in my life - I also need to stay healthy and I need, I want a 6 pack by years end if it kills me      3. work on being social despite my physical problems and hopefully I will win out with whatever way it goes      4. help your community out and help others - remember you have been bad and need to fulfill certain things because the lord put me here for a reason and I want to be helpful and give happiness to others since I am not happy at least     Remember to keep it real and tight  . CAN'T NOBODY HOLD ME DOWN!!!!  I CAN'T STOP! I WON'T STOP! I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO STOP!   ) \"),\n",

       " Document(page_content='As of right now, I\\'m pretty happy with my life. The only thing that I question are relationship issues. After breaking up with my long-time girlfriend 6 months ago, I haven\\'t dated any other person. I think I\\'m just lonely and miss the having a girlfriend\" lifestyle. The girls I have met as friends I might have considered them possible girlfriend-material when in actuality they weren\\'t, again because I missed having a girlfriend. Recently, I\\'ve gotten over the issue a bit. I\\'ve spent time with all my friends. That\\'s the good thing about being single, you have more time for your friends. When I was going out for my ex, which by the way the relationship lasted nearly 3 years, I didn\\'t have much time for friends. Not only that, but I chose to be with my girlfriend as opposed to my friends. This issue of mine, it\\'s made me a bit more self conscious. I got the idea in my head that looks really do matter. Seriously though, having a \"deep\" relationship is important and yadda yadda,but I really do feel that looks matter too. A friend and I were discussing this. She is been there for me a lot. When I broke up with my ex-girlfriend, she was there for me to complain to. Anyways, she said that looks don\\'t matter and it only matters a small percentage of time. I argued with her saying that she is right that looks are only a small percentage but unfortunately that\\'s what matters at the very beginning. I met this very interesting girl this summer. Her name is Serena. She was telling me about her past, how she was somewhat of a \"geek\" in high school. She didn\\'t care about her looks or anything. She is a very bright girl, very deep. Likes art and many things most girls just don\\'t take interest anymore. She said that she realized she felt she HAD to start dressing up to attract people first, then and only then would they be able to see the \"real\" side of her. I completely agree with this. There is no way people can see the real side of you unless they give you a chance and unfortunately being given a chance means you have to attract them somehow. Ever since then, I\\'ve gotten a bit obsessed with my physical features. I never did care about it much. I was in a long relationship so thoughts of attracting others didn\\'t really enter my mind. During this recent period, I\\'ve started to lift weights a bit and work out my body. Another thought of relationships I\\'ve always wondered is at what point do you really have to \"settle\"? The reality is that most likely you will never find the perfect girl. When you date someone, how far into the future should you consider? Unfortunately for me, I should\\'ve realized in my last relationship that there was no future. Instead, because of my fear of being alone, I stayed with her. for nearly 3 years. It was fun and all, but we had many arguments. The reality was we were two different people. Two different backgrounds, interests, ideas, practically everything. My parents didn\\'t like her because she wasn\\'t chinese and wasn\\'t very bright. (I\\'m Chinese by the way). I\\'d like to talk about my family for a second. I was born in Taiwan, and moved to the USA when I was four. Thus, I speak/write fluent English but can only speak chinese(Mandarin) since I still speak it at home. I would like to think that my family is still pretty traditional, which I really like. Like most chinese families, my parents stressed educational when I was growing up. Sometimes I think this is why there is the stereotype of \"asians being smarter in school\". I think it\\'s because traditionally, chinese families stress education a bit more than others. The bad thing about growing up in a \"traditional\" family is that living in the USA, I did not experience certain American family activities. My dad never took me fishing, camping, or anything \"fatherly\". I think that was one of the things I really disliked about him. Growing up, I always favored my mom more. Now that I\\'m in college, I talk to my dad a lot more when I go back home, including cars, sports, politics, etc. Going home, I\\'m spoiled with food. My mom is always thinking I\\'m going to starve to death. Everytime I come back up to Austin, she makes me bring a whole bunch of food. My grandparents(dad\\'s side) also lives very close to me in Houston. My grandparents came to the USA a couple of years before us, which is how we were able to. I remember growing up and laying awake at night, my biggest fear in the world was that I\\'d lose my grandpa (to old age). It\\'s still my biggest fear because he is been an avid smoker since almost forever. We\\'ve tried to tell him to quit and he knows its bad for him, but he just won\\'t. He says he has nothing better to do during the daytime, and to let him enjoy it. He is even said something close to \"I\\'ve already experienced everything in life. My family is doing good. I have nothing else to live for\" Now, don\\'t take this to be a suicidal comment for anything, he was saying it as if it were wise words. On my part, its hard to argue with him. He is my grandpa and I can\\'t really tell him to just stop what he likes so much. Personally, I have a very big problem with talking to people. This problem has been solved a bit ever since coming to college. Since there are so many people around, it\\'s hard to not get use to it. When I\\'m around people, I\\'m always worried that what I say will make them think negatively of me. That\\'s why I\\'ll usually always rethink what I want to say in my mind before I actually say it. Funny thing is, my chinese name translated to english is \"brave speaker\". I know I have a problem with caring too much what others think of me but I just can\\'t help it. Growing up I didn\\'t have that many friends, so I thought to myself a lot and that\\'s still true. Around strangers, I\\'m really quiet. Only around friends am I a bit more active. And my 20 minutes are up. This was pretty useful. Glad I could type out what I was thinking. Now I got to go get caught up on reading those boring chapters from the psychology book. The lectures are much more interesting. '),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"     Well i just got back from Houston, where i live. It was weird going back. Kind of like this isn't my home anymore, even though Austin isn't my home. It's just my temporary home. It's weird though seeing my parents, knowing that I won't see them for a long time. It was good to see them again. I hope I'm not going to make myself too crazy up here with school. School is my number one priority. I want to have a good life after this, i don't want to end up in a job i hate. Hopefully i figure out what i want to do with my life. I don't know if i want to teach, or work for a record label, or write for the rest of my life, or do something with crime scene investigation. I think being a criminal psycologist would be a lot of fun. I bet it would never get boring! I just hope I'm not getting in over my head with this class. I've always been interested in psycology, and how people act and why, and what causes it, but I'm afraid i will be over my head. Hopefully not. It seems like it will be very intersting despite the hard work I know will come. It's very strange being in a class that's so huge! I'm used to being in classes with no more than 30 people. I guess all freshmen are though. I still feel like I'm kind of out of place sometimes here. Luckily I've been making friends with the people on my floor. Everyone here seems really cool. There are a few girls down the hall that are soo cool! I could see myself being friends with them for awhile. I hope so at least! Everyone here seems very nice and friendly. (At least the people on my half of the floor does. ) The other side seems very anti-social. We all have our doors open on this side of the floor, but I never see any of their doors open down the hall. It's strange, but i don't really miss many of my friends. I don't think this makes me a bad friend, I just think i was ready to separate from them. Some of them at least. But I thought I was going to miss some of them SO much, but in reality, I don't miss many of them. Especially some of the friends I was supposedly   best friends   with. I sometimes wonder if I'm missed. I wonder if I was as good of a friend as i thought I was. I don't know. One of the girls down the floor just got back frlom out of town. She's one of the girls i think i could be good friends with for awhile after this year. She's a lot like me! Surprisingly. It's hard to find people who don't really drink, and have more fun just hanging out, and going bowling, or going to the movies, instead of going to a frat, or a big party. It's cool though that she's like that. It's nice to find someone who likes the same things you do, especially when they're so uncommon around college kids! I've only been back for a few hours, and I don't miss my parents! I thought i would miss them more. I think this means I'm grown up now! haha, grown up. That's weird to think. I don't feel like I'm grown up. I still feel like the same old nerd from Houston. haha. I finally threw my flowers out that were sent to me, and washed the vase. They were starting to smell a little funky. Danielle, my roommate just got back from the grocery store. I hope she bought good food! hehe. The food here is pretty good though, surprisingly. Not like home, but good enough to eat. Some of it is really good though, you just have to pick the right things is all. I could talk about food all day! haha. I can't wait to watch Sex and the City tonight with some girs from the floor. Since we don't get HBO here my mom taped the last 2 episodes and I brought them abck for all of us poor girls with no HBO! Hopefully Emily gets back from dropping her boyfriend off at SW in not too long. I have an early class in the morning, and i don't want to miss it. Especially since it's a class of 14 people, it would be hard to go unnoticed. I think it will be a fun class. It's Jazz and Literature. I love listening to jazz, but there's going to be a lot of writing and reading. Hopefully the writing will be fun. I love creative writing and writing like this, just writing whatever comes to my head. But essays and stuff aren't that fun. I don't know anyone who likes writing them though. My rhetoric class is going to be a lot of that not fun writing though. Yuck. Oh well it's a class I have to take. Hopefully I'll enjoy it though. Otherwise it's going to be hard to drag myself to the class every Tuesday and Thursday. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='After spending almost an hour trying to get my computer at home to work on-line, I finally got here. So what do I say?  Well, I guess everybody says that the first time that they do this assignment. I guess all that is going through my head right now is the advancement of the classroom. I am actually fulfilling an assignment by typing on the internet. I think it is pretty cool, though I am a little worried about what the future has to offer. The future is probably a real uncertain thing for me. I do not know where I will be in ten years or even ten months from now. Will college work out for me?  Will I change my major from Advertising to Design and back again or will I totally steer from the graphic arts which I so dearly love and take up a new love or hidden talent. Well, I do not know. I guess that it is all the future really is to me, just a bunch of questions with unclear and vague answers. It is probably the same way for everyone else, at least I hope. What else do I want to type on my new fancy Compaq laptop?  I don\\'t know? As I ponder this a song I heard today keeps coming out and no matter what I do I cannot get it out of my head. And as the case always is I can only remember a few lines, while I try to hum the rest. \"Blue skies -- all of them gone -- nothing but blue skies from now on\" and that is all I can remember. When I come to think of it I really never heard this song today or anything, it just popped into my head. It is from With Honors, my most favorite movie of all time. I don\\'t no whether it is the actors I like, the music, or the emphasis on Walt Whitman, one of my favorite poets, along with everybody else. Everytime I take a pause the song starts coming into my head again. When I really listen to the words of the song it is talking about your future, pretty coincidental, I might add. It is almost scary!  But that is what I am going to have in my future, nothing but \"blue skies\". I think that that is too optimistic for my blood. I am usually the glass-is-half-empty-kind-of-guy. And I do not know -- DARNIT I HIT THAT CAPS LOCK BUTTON FOR THE MILLIONTH TIEM AGAIN. I hat that when I am typing really fast and the ideas are flowing and then -WAM- you hit the caps lock button or some other button  that makes you take time and fix what is in caps or something else. To totally get off the subject or anything, but it is a really beautiful day out, today. If it wasn\\'t so hot outside I probably would be outside right now, instead of in here typing this - whatever it is?  Speaking of being hot. It just me or does it just keep getting hotter as you walk all the way across campus for a class. Well I guess it is better than rain. I always want the grass on the other side of the fence -- my mother says to me all the time. I informed her the other day that I was going to have a better life when I become rich and famous. As I soon found out that I shouldn\\'t have brought up this subject to my mother, because she spouted for the millionth time that the \"Grass is not always greener on the other side. \"  I totally do not agree with that. I just told her that I want things to be better and that you always need to strive for the best and I think that there is nothing wrong with that. My hands are starting to hurt!  I think I am going to stop. I feel sorry for the person who has to sit down and read this. Well I bid you farewell. And may all your skies be blue! '),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"     Gregory benjamin's writhing assingment, september 11, 2001. today was a decent day, architeture studio was great, and interesting, although we got a major project due for friday. Everyone in our studio is freaking out over it, but I don't think it would be so bad. In the meantime, I still to to catch up on some reading for my architecture and society class, even though the book is dreadfully boring. I do not want to read it! It is simply boring! Blah, Blah, Blah, building, blah blah blah. I am an architecture major, and this book is boring, that should say something. I wish we could just hurry up and read the little black book, thats Thermal Delight in Architecture that is. It is way more interesting, and talks about actual concepts rather than just buildings in general like some books. . uhhhhh (experiencing architecture). BORING!. On thursday, I have Visual Communication, a class that basicly teaches us how to draw. The proffesor there is annoying sometimes, since he thinks he knows everything and he DOES NOT. I honestly think he is teaching for an ego trip, he continues to put down many of the students, he is lucky he hasn't crossed pathes with me because i will at least defend myself. Anyways, i am majoring in somehing I love to do, so I guess i can trudge though the school. Some of my business friends may make fun of me for that reason, but at least i won't be pulling my hair out because my employes are idiots! (plus, i won't be working at Wal-Mart, the consumer of business). Speaking of stuff i love to do, I love music! I really had a hard decision deciding on rather majoring in music or architecture. . . but since I have been wanting to do architecture since I was like, FOUR, i choose it. . (it all started with legos). . .  On a diffrent note, this page is buggy because when you press enter, then backspace, it returns to the previous page, so when you press forward, it returns to this page, except the COUNTER RESET!!! NOOOOO! there goes five minutes of typing!!! luckily, i am a very patient person :) &lt;----not very formal, hope this isn't read. (yeah right, out of a class of 500? please, i wa sbearly noticed in my high school class of 680, and i knew people there. speaking of people from HIgh Scool, one of them is in this class. Say hello to Jeff Prudon everyone! (this is ment to be read in front of class, but since it probably won't, i might as well TRY to call him out) you get your own personl shout out Jeff! from the Proffesor too! (or whoever is reading). Jeff is a business major, and tries to brag that he will make more money than me. . . but all i say is I LOVE WHAT I DO and, you won't be saying that when you are ready to build your dream house. . AND again, I won't be having a heartattack because my employes are lazy and stupid, because we work in a group. not a hiearchy. &lt;---seems to be spelled wrong. i CAN  T SPELL worth CRAP&gt; the computer has spoiled me with spell check, and grammar check. Darn microsoft, just trying to make us all more stupid over a period of time, so we are just brainwashed into buying only thier products! (oh wait. we already are!) I am running win XP right now :) i do like it, it hasn't crashed yet. . knock on wood. it would crash while i am doing something for class though, with my terrible luck. (spelling? was something wrong?) well. if it wasnt for that back bug earlier, i would have benn finished by now, but i still have 4 minutes left! Hey, maybe that was my bad luck! now my computer won;'t crash because that was bad enough! Muhhahahahaah!!!!!!! ok. . now this is where i really just waste time typing, because i have nothing to type about any more. I guess, i could just recopy my notes i took in your class how aboutt hat! It would be similar to studying! hmmm. . zarconic effect-willingness to finish something. . . zzzzzzz. . . WHOOPS! sorry about that. fell asleep for a second. . actually i didn't. I find your class interesting and entertaining, i don't go asleep in it, i fall asleep in Arch&soc. the chairs are so comfortable, and he shows slides everyday, so he always turn off the lights. . recipe for sleep! now my 20min are up, and i have to sleep myself!   \"),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"Well I figured since I want to go to bed at midnight I would write for 20 minutes now so I don't forget. I always tend to think at night. Stuff runs through my mind because I let it wander. I don't know if this is a bad thing or a good thing, but I do it anyway. I just finished studying for a chemistry test tomorrow. It is my first college test so I am a little nervous. I know that I have to do well in all my classes in order to get into medical school. I think I will do fine though. I have done all that stuff before in high school. So far the largest difference I have noticed between high school and college is that the professor expects you to know what he or she is talking about. They don't explain things as thoroughly as they do in high school. Oh well I guess I will become accustomed to it. I don't mind the reading I have to do so that isn't too bad. I have met a lot of new people here and I like the college a lot. One thing I do want though is a girlfriend. I like this one girl but she has a boyfriend back home so it is kind of hard. I seem to be able to pick out the ones that have boyfriends all ready. I was in the same situation almost with one of my good friends that just left for the Navy. I say almost because she liked me also, but had been going on with her boyfriend for a long time. We were friends back in seventh grade but then she moved and we kind of kept in touch through the years and then on day she called and I hadn't heard from her in over a year. I told her that we had to get together and do something. So I went over to her house for spring break and we spent the next two weeks together. I had so much fun. I felt as though we were meant for each other. It is kind of hard to explain the feeling I had when I was around her. Well I told her and she said that she liked me too but couldn't break up with her boyfriend and then go out with me. I asked her why not and she said that she couldn't be with me and then have to leave for the Navy. I talked to some of my friends and they said that it was because she knew that I would not let her leave and her current boyfriend would. I don't know if that is it or not, but regardless we went out a whole lot and spent a bunch of time together. I always had a wonderful time with her. Then I left and then she left. I came here and she is in Chicago for boot camp. I miss her a lot. Then I met this one girl from my high school, which I knew but not that well. In the last few weeks we have become real good friends. She reminds me of my friend in the Navy, and I can't figure out if that is one of the reasons that I like her or not. I think it might play a bit of a role in it, but I am not sure. Well she has a boyfriend also so I am in the same position as before only I am not sure how she feels towards me. I received a post card from my friend in the navy today. It felt good to hear from her. I have to write her back tomorrow. Well it is midnight so I think I am going to head to bed. I know that I will continue to think through the night. That is just what I do. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"I just got home from a friend's apartment today. As of right now I have so many thoughts going through my mind. I have a hard decision coming up to make. It is if I want to join a soroity or not. One of my really good friends is going to rush this semester. I'm not sure if I want to do if she is going to at the same time. I'm not sure it is the right thing to do together. However, I'm still tempted to do it. The question is if it is right for me. My parents would both flip out if they found out I wanted to do it. When they hear the word   soroity   they automatically think drinking and drugs. However I have met many people in different soroity's and they are all really good people. Many of them are smart and do not fit your stereotypical soroity girl. All of the ones I have talked to swear by their life that it has made them a better person. One of my really good friends is in one and she has improved in character in only good ways. I remember her back in high school, and compared to now she is much more confident. There are many other things that she says has helped her character but that is the one that stands out the most. I really don't know what to do. It's all up in the air for now. I should talk to someone else outside of the college atmosphere and see what they think. I'm trying to collect opinions, but they have all been negative so far. Those negative opinions prolong my decision making. I figure if I do it then I have to do it now or I never will. The bad part is that I want  no regrets later. I don't want to look back and say   I wish I had done that.   I've made that mistake before and, don't want to do it time and again. I think a soroity is a great way to get involved with community activities as well. I know there are volunteer groups out there. I love doing community service and the events they do really benefit other people. Another one of my concerns is the time consumption. I know if I do this all of my waking moments will be dedicated to this one thing. I'm not sure if I can handle that or not. Plus I don't take rejection very well either. So I'd rather not risk it, but then again there is that no regrets thing playing in the process. Guess decisions will be made at a later time when I have more information about everything. Right now I like the college life that I'm living. I've met great people. My only complaint is about my room. It's so cold in here that I'm going to catch hypothermia and die before the semester is over. I can't feel my hands and I have to wear sweatershirts and slippers all the time. I doubt anyone can do to much about it. It's only been ten minutes since I started this assignment. I feel like it's been the full twenty. Another thing I don't like about my floor here in Jester is the fighting over the washing machines. For awhile we only had one working washing machine for the entire floor. I'd have to do my laundry at like 4 in the morning just to get some of it done. Now we have three but they always seem to be busy, and no one comes to take out their clothes when they are finished washing. As if no one else needed the machines. I swear sometimes I think I'm never going to have clean clothes again. I bought more socks just in case I didn't get clean ones for a long time. Sadly, I've only been here two weeks in Austin and I've already been to the Highland mall three times. Each time I really have no idea why my friends and I went. Only one time did we have something that we had to get immediately. All it was a white shirt for a party. The traffic down here gets on my nerves. I think Austin has the worst highway system in the world. How could someone construct such an awful system?  Don't they see the danger they are putting all the drivers in. I think I've nearly gotten into like ten wrecks. It's crazy. It's so hard to get around. Just simply trying to get to a Walmart is a pain. Thankfully I don't have to go that often. Ever since I got to Austin I my nights and days have gotten a little thrown off. I sleep at such random hours sometimes. I'm suprised I'm not sick yet. With the cold room and the funky sleeping times. Oh well it's the price you pay to be at UT. I'm so scared that I'm not going to do well in my classes. I'm not the worlds greatest test taker. Since all of my classes are based on tests I'm worried. I concentrate and pay attention but I know that's not enough to make it. My study habits are bad too. I need to get some new ones really quick!   \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='If you complain about the universality of math as a required subject, just try and spend one day without encountering some form of mathematics. From page numbers to prices to today뗩 date, math puts things in order and enables us to compare quantitatively. Figuring how much time is required, how much of an ingredient must be measured, how much carpet to buy, all of these everyday experiences require familiarity with math. To survive 遼nancially you must use math to allocate your resources. If you want to invest in a business or in the stock market you must know how to deal with the numbers. Understanding graphs and other analyses about the economy or politics or consumer con遼dence are enhanced by the applications of math. Mathematical applications in the study of science are essential. Track- ing the orbits of planets and the locations of stars in the galaxy cannot be done without numerical comparisons. Every discipline, from archeology to zoology, bene遼ts in some way from the use of mathematics.Practical reasons for the need for mathematics are omnipresent, but there are other, perhaps more esoteric reasons, for interest in this subject. The amazing coincidences found in numbers provide continual fascination. An example is the fact that the sum of the numbers in the products of the 9-times table add up to nine. Nine times 遼ve equals forty-遼ve, and four plus 遼ve equals nine. Similarly, the numbers in the product of seven times nine also equal nine. Mathematicians are also especially fascinated with unique geometric relationships. An example is the fact that three pyramids of the same height will exactly 遼t into a prism of equal height.A teacher of mathematics once told me, Math is in everything, and some people say, Mathematics is the something for which the world was written. These are reasons enough for requiring its study.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"I really have no idea what to write about. I am home for the weekend from my first half week of college. It feels like I have just been on vacation and am home now. Some of my friends wanted me to go dancing with them tonight, but I took some allergy medicine and I have no desire to dance. The medicine makes me so tired. My dad is very upset with my cat because while I have been away, she has gone to the bathroom on lots of his important papers. She only does that when she is upset about something. I guess she misses me. We used to have a cocker spaniel named lady, but we had to get her put to sleep a while back. She was a wonderful dog. I am bringing my fish back with me when I go back to Austin tomorrow. That is the only kind of pet we can have in the dorm. I had to sell my horse before I left for college. I had had him for almost three years so it was really hard. I still haven't sold all of my equipment. I can never find enough time to go out to the barn and get it taken care of. Princess Diana died in a car accident this morning. I really didn't think that all of that royal family stuff mattered to me, but I guess after hearing so much about her life in the last couple of years, we all feel like we have some connection with her. Anyway, I think it is really really sad. I especially feel so bad for her children. I was watching 60 Minutes on TV a little while ago and they showed a clip of the two boys on a fishing trip with their father. My brothers and I used to fish a lot with the family too. It is weird to think that my brothers are getting so old. One of them is 22 and the other one is almost 26. That is hard to believe. I just turned 18 on Friday. It was sort of nice to come home for my birthday where people actually care that it is my birthday. I am also glad I came home because that way, I can be sure that I keep in touch with my friends who are still in high school. I want to go to the homecoming football game at my high school. I am already getting excited about my ten year high school reunion. I think it will be so cool to see how much people have changed. I went to Camp Texas at the end of the summer and a girl that was in my group lived near where I used to live in Houston. She told me that a girl I used to know in elementary and middle school was killed by some guy. It was so shocking and really sad. I mean, I didn't know the girl really well and it had been many years since I had seen her, but it still made me think about how things like that really can happen to anyone. My roommate at Towers is really cool. I am glad we get along. I was worried I might get some freak. I can just imagine that if I had to request a change of roommates how acquired that would be to see the old roommate around campus knowing that you had ditched them. Twenty minutes of writing is a lot longer than I thought it would be. I think I still have a few minutes left. I think we have some raccoons living under our house because you can hear them sometimes scurrying around. Sometimes they are really, really loud. We used to have a mouse in our house so we had the exterminator put out one of those little sticky trap things. Well, it caught the mouse, but then my cat tried to get the mouse so she ended up getting the trap stuck to her paw. It was in the middle of the night and I heard her running around the house like a freak. Finally I got up to see what was wrong and I took the trap off of her. The mouse appeared to be dead so I put it in a baggy but when I got up in the morning, I found out it was still alive so I tried putting it outside but it was too stunned to move so I put it in a little cage until it recovered its senses. It finally got better so I let it go. I had to let it go far away from my house though  because my mom was afraid it would come back in. My cat got lost for eleven days once when we lived in Houston. It was so sad. I cried everyday until we finally found her again. I think my twenty minutes is up now. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Well, the twenty minutes start now. It feels strange having to write out what I am thinking. Seeing as how I\\'ve never had a diary or journal, I\\'ve never had to do this before. Funny how your mind draws a blank when you are supposed to be writing what you are thinking at that very instant. A whole minute has gone by and I can not think of anything to type. I guess that\\'s kind of the purpose. don\\'t think ahead for once, just let everything come out just as quickly as it comes in. all day long, my mind has been jumbled up with. well, stuff, and now I can\\'t seem to remember what all the \"stuff\" was. Gosh, it\\'s early and I\\'m already tired. It\\'s not that today was stressful, just very hot and tiring. I can\\'t wait until the weather finally cools off. I wish I could sleep in tomorrow. I wish I could go to sleep now. I hope what I actually write isn\\'t important. After all, it\\'s only a completion grade, right? I hope so. Sigh. Now that I\\'m thinking about it, this class kind of worries me, after 5 class days in here, I\\'m still not sure what to study or what to write down in my notes, the TA at the supplemental instructions class, I can\\'t remember her name at the moment, says that we should pay attention to the book and the notes. But I think we wanted a more concise answer. My philosophy class is exactly the same. No body knows what to write in their notes, after all, all the notes we take are basically made up of questions. I\\'m a bit nervous about my first test in that class. And we are only going to have three, and that\\'s counting the final. It has its good and bad points I guess. Double standard. Since I\\'ve started college, it seems like everything is a double standard. I don\\'t live on campus that has its good and bad points. Umm, what else? Lots of things. hard to come with them right now. Dang, I still have to read for my writing class. ugh, that book is boring, I hope I don\\'t fall asleep reading it again. More than likely I will seeing as how I\\'m sleepy right now. I think I should just read tomorrow while I\\'m on the shuttle to school. That\\'d be good. Oh, I can\\'t. I have to get on the early bus tomorrow, it\\'s going be too packed to be able to concentrate. Guess I have to read tonight. Oh well. Gosh, I\\'m tired. Wait. My mom always calls when I\\'m in the middle of something. Weird. Why did she need my schedule? I bet so she could call when she knows I\\'m not in class. I know this sounds bad, but I don\\'t want to talk to her everyday. Every time she calls, she sounds like she\\'s upset with me. I think she\\'s mad because I left home. But it\\'s not like I went out of the country, or out of state for that matter. I\\'m only 3 hours away, and I\\'m going home this weekend to visit anyway. She doesn\\'t have reason to be upset with me. She\\'s supposed to happy and proud. It was always hard to make her proud. Nothing ever seemed good enough for her. But not my dad, he\\'s different. As long as I tried, my dad was always proud of me; I love him for that. Well, there goes my timer. 20 minutes is up. Thank you. '),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"     My thoughts are so mixed up, I don't really know where to start. I have been really upset with myself lately because for the life of me, I cannot seem to focus on school at all. Not only can I not study, but just sitting in class, I find myself constantly tuning the proffessor out and thinking of irrelevant things. I hate this about myself, how i cannot stay focused on things that matter and how I dwell on insignificant things that I should not think about during this time, mainly my relationships with guys. I always fall for the ones that will hurt me, and indeed they do, and even right now I am interested in someone who I know will treat me bad and will not be a good person to me but that is why i think i chase after him. It's like I am trying to get hurt by these guys. I don't ever like a guy that likes me back, i only like the ones that i know i won't have a chance with or that are rude and immature. This part of my life takes up so much of my time and it shouldnt. i should focus on things that are important. i should try to work harder in school. but i dont. and this is why i am so upset with myself. i want to be a better student so bad but i cant. i hate it. i get so easily distracted and theres nothing i can do about it, i never used to be like this its just recently this has happened. no matter what, i don't try to work. im just lazy and always tired, never wanting to do anything that involves much activity. but this is probably one of the only things i really get mad at myself about, besides the whole thing with guys. even my friends tell me to stay away from them, but i just cant. SEE, there i go again, off track and thinking of stuff i shouldnt be. i guess i expected college to be different. i expected everyone to be so mature and not act like they did in high school, but honestly, nothing has changed. you still get screwed over by the same people and get in fights. yeah, its nice to have independence, but i had it at home to an extent, too. i feel like now when i go home everything is different since i don't live there anymore, like i don't fit in there and like everything everyone does bothers me because i am no longer used to it. i want to be happier with myself, i really think i am a great person who has so much to offer to the world, but i block that out often and just concentrate on the negativities in my life. why? i don't know! i always have done that, i always some how find drama to dwell on for no reason! it sucks! so im going to concentrate on some of the better things going on. friends--my friends are awesome, i love them to death, it was really hard for me to part with them but ill stay close to them, i know i will, i have to. family- i have the best family ever. they care for me so much its crazy. the love i have for them could never be measured in any way. im sitting in my dorm room which is supposed to have 4 people since it is a suite but i am alone. here its like you have to fend for yourself and no one is really there for you always like it was at home. once again, as i sit here, inside i am yelling at myself because i am thinking of all the work that i need to be doing for school. why do i punish myself like this? why don't i just DO the work and then feel good? i wish i knew how. i need motivation, something that tells me to go for it because in the end it will be all worth it when i am an optometrist and i can help people with their ailments. that day seems like it is going to be soooooo far away, 8 years!! aaah!! i feel like im running short on things to say, my head is all jumbled up with thoughts of calculus, chemistry, and boys. if i could just get that last subject to leave me alone how much easier this would be!! i worry about everything, about how the heck im going to get all my work done and do well in my classes, about my family, about my friends, about everything. its hard for me to trust people once they have broken my trust, and i worry about trusting people here because so many of them are so fake. i never know whats going on with them and how genuine they really are. but then theres God, my light, my soul, my heart. God gets me through it, God loves me, and I love God. Thank You. I'm sure this sounds like a jumble of the most random stuff, but this is how i think inside. its all mixed up and thats how i feel so often, all mixed up.  \"),\n",

I'm so glad we have monday off A&M doesn't' even have this holiday but I guess that they started later than we did. I'm going there this weekend and I can't wait to see my closest friends in all the world because they all went there I'm glad I didnt even though I miss them dearly because I have been forced to meet all kinds of new people and I have met some really nice ones, not as great as my best freinds but then again its only been two weeks they all seem to be sticking together pretty much which I think I s pretty dumb because they are never going to grow up if they don't start spreading there wings so to speak. its kinda funny that I just happened to look at my watch and I have been writing for ten minutes now I always seem to look at it in 5-10-15 minute increments. maybe myu internal clock is really acurate or something. I dunno. I'm really tired right now even though I got a lot of sleep the other night maybe I just need even more. I need more sleep thatn anyone I know I wonder if I get more tired because I convince myself I didnt get enough sleep or if I'm actually really tired. I think I do get really tired becuase it starts to show on my face, I get horrible bags under my eyes and I just look gross. like right now. plus I am totally broken out, more than I have ever been, but I'm hoping that its just the stress from going off to colegio. who knows well see in about a week. why is it that sometimes your face turns red. I hate that so much I feel so exposed when that happens. I can feel it getting hotter and I think that makes me even more self concious which in turn makes mya face even more red. I wonder if people you don't know notice when you blush or is it not as obvious as it seems. i didnt used to blush but now I occasionally do a t really inopportune times . like today when a guy I think is attractive said hi to me I got all flustered. its so stupid I don't even know him and I've convinced myself that we are destined to be together. sometimes I am so unrealistic when it comes to relationships correction I am always unrealistic that is something hard for me to admit to because in admitting that I feel let down. I get really dejected when it comes to guys, and I don't theink that any good ones exist even though I know in theory that isn't true I just havent come accross anyone who has disproved it to me. maybe its because I don't attract the nice guys because I'm sending off a negative vibe that was on oprah the other day. they were saying how can you attract someone if you automatically have a bad attitude about it and think that they couldnt possibly be worhty of you. I dunno. I can't stop thinking all guys are bad just to attract a guy because I think that is the wrong motive for changing my opinion. its like in bridget jones diary she does stuff like that sometimes I remind myself of her except not as extreme. well of course not she was a complete lunatic. I wish my parents were not in ireland right now becasue I would looooovvvveeee to see them this weekend but I can wait I miss them so much I think because we get along so incredibly well its really abnormal I think no one else I know gets along as well with there parents as I do its really cool I thinkwow I went over the 20 minutes who would have guessed thats kinda weird everytime I mentioned the time I said wow. huh \"),\n",

This is like my fourth time trying to complete this assignment and I am so tired of it but it is to late to complain now so I might as well shut up and continue on writing or shall I say typing. It looks again like I will be going to bed after midnight, I hope not but I do have a lot of assignments that I still need to complete. My most important assignment will be to get organized because going at this rate I will have a hell of a freshman year just trying to keep up. I am doing a little better now with following my syllabus but I still have a long way to go. Maybe when I get a job I will learn how to manage my time more wisely and I will be able to develop better study skills. My fiance' tells me that I have good study skills I just worry to much and stress myself out over small unimportant things that have nothing to do with my classes or myself. To be honest, I do believe that I do get stressed out over every little thing but I think that I am getting a lot better at handling different situations, like this one. My biggest problem is that I really miss him and it is so hard being here in Austin all alone while he is in North Carolina. Hopefully after this year we will be able to come up with a compromise and a solution to all of our problems and concerns. I miss him and I am really looking forward into seeing him in a couple of months. Well, my time is about up and I really need to go so that I can begin to tackle my other UT coursework. I have to make my grades so that they won't make me. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"     I'm really not sure what exactly I am suppossed to write about so I thought I would write about the biggest thing that has been on my mind these days, and that's September 11th. That morning I woke up and things didn't seem any different. I put on my I love New York shirt and went to class. Truthfully, I was very dissapointed with the people here at UT and how they acted that day. People in my freshman seminar were actually really rude about it. The tower played American Songs for about 10 minutes and they were really mad about it. It was   getting in the way of our discussion.   WHATEVER!!  We should have been discussing September 11!!  One girl in the class said,   Who cares!!  People die every day!!  We kill people in Afganistan every day and we don't hold memorials for them!!    I personally was outraged by that comment. How disrespectful for her to say that on a day like that. That night I went with my friends to the memorial at the tower. We stayed for a couple minutes and then proceeded to walk to the capital building for the memorial that was held there. It was awesome. To be standing there next to my friends, people that I loved, and listen to the songs and here the speeches was very emotional. To hear the bagpipes play and see the fireman and the policeofficers. And then a fire man talked about how when they lose a fireman they ring the firebell, so they did that. The whole crowd stood in silence while it rang. It was very powerful. You couldn't help but stand there and think about the officers in New York who had gone into the world trade centers, doing their job and knowing that they could be killed but WANTING to go in anyways. I had to think about all the families who walked around for days not knowing if their family members were dead or alive. Walking from hospital to hospital praying that they would be there. And in the weeks after, hoping that they would even find them dead, just so there would be some closure and they wouldn't have to wonder anymore. At the capital, the police or whatever it was also shot the rifles off. I forget what that is called but that was also a very powerful moment. In almost every person in the crowd's eyes there were tears. You couldn't help it. Then the whole crowd sang God Bless America. Hearing this and looking out over the top and seeing all these people of all different ages and sexes and races holding their american flags up above their heads and just singing GOD BLESS AMERICA was absolutely amazing. I knelt down where I was and said a prayer to thank God for my family and my friends and for the fact that was SO blessed. I picked up the phone and called my mom to tell her that I love her. My family is the most important thing in the world to me and if I lost any of them I don't know how I could even go on. When it was over, two huge beams of light shone up from the back of the capital building to represent the twin towers. It made me think about the pictures I had seen from ground zero of the towers of light they had there. A very powerful sight. The man who was talking over the microphone said that the two huge lights that were shining behind the capital were both there in Pearl Harbor on December 7th. That was an amazing thought to me also. It was also very symbolic to show that the two lights had managed to withstand something that horrible and are now representing hope after another great American tragedy. However, this was a tragedy but not just that. In fact, it brought america closer than it has been in a really long time. I saw a commericial that gave me the chills. It was a video shot of a row of normal looking houses in a normal looking American city. The voice in the background said   On September 11, 2001, terrorists tried to change America forever.   The screen faded out, and then it slowly faded back in. The same houses were there but this time every house had like 5 or 6 american flags around it. In the yard, in the windows, hanging from the roof, just everywere. The voice said   They succeeded.   I think that is a perfect way to say what September 11 has done for America. Yea, so many people lost their lives, but people in AMerica are showing pride that they haven't shown in a long time. At this point in my life, I am VERY PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"This is my stream of consciousness writing for psychology class. I'm going to use periods and capitalize out of habit O. K. I had a dream two nights ago and I was at some Hollywood awards ceremony. This lady introduced me to kirstie Allie as I was sitting at a table. I looked over, and it was not Kirstie Allie but Andie Mcdowell, some other actress. Anyway, it was weird. Then on the very next night after that dream, I was watching a movie on T. V. and she was in it. I rarely see her on T. V. and I was astonished. It is very relevant, because I am reading a book right now called the Celestine Prophecy. This book is very cool. It talks about some ancient manuscript found in Peru that is going to change every human beings consciousness. It is very involved, but the first insight in this manuscript says that at the end of the 20th century people are going to become more and more aware of these coincidences. It is amazing because I have been having many of these lately such as that dream. Also, on the way over here  I turned on my car, and I thought of this song by Jewel. I turned the station and that song was on the radio. Unbelievable, right?  I don't think so, man,/. this kind of thing happens to me all the time. Ok I finished a focus question for history class before I came here and I also watched Seinfeld. It was the one where Jerry picks up a deaf lineswoman at a tennis match. George makes a mess of himself with an ice-cream sundae and they get it on T. V. George\\x92s girlfriend breaks up with him and he doesn't know why then Kramer tells George alright I'm not gonna sit here and talk about Seinfeld for 20 minutes. I am so happy like not really just kidding alright wrong here we go alright You are all just a bunch of hacks. Lets get ready to rumble in the Bronx Joy boy girl swirl pearl grapes of wrath. Nietzche's theory on Dionysus man Let's call ourselves the Doors man. Like the doors in your mind, acid. Aldous Huxley. When the doors of perception are cleansed, we will see things as they truly are, immaculate. That was a line from Oliver stones, The Doors good flick. It is total irony how Jim Morrison has a poem where he says, Did you have a good life when you died, Enough to base the movie on. He must have known they would make a movie about him. Strange days. I'm taking Tai Chi classes. That should be very beneficial to me. I must do well in school this semester. Man that is a big deal to me Wow I'm really looking forward to the UCLA football game. It should be a good one. I really want a piece of glass you  know. My grandmother died last week on the same night Princess Diana  died. Was that some kind of luck, or what. I want to die at a reasonable age. Death, now there's something I could talk about Nope let's see Mi hermano no va a California para la funeral. Neither am I. Is that wrong, I don't think so. Man let's just increase the peace I can't believe I just said that There is a reason to live. We are all one consciousness functioning at different levels on the same paralysis of unending consequences of our reaction to the global warming issue in South America for the love of Peirre.

       " Document(page_content=\"I don't know what to expect. By best friend's father passed away Monday and I am really worried about the family. His mother does not work and he is in college without much financial aid. I hope he will be able to continue school, but I don't know what's going to happen. I am scared to face them, though. I can't see the family being whole without the father. They were always so close to one another and could share anything with each other. I envied that relationship because my family was broken up at an early age. When my father and mother divorced, I was only about two or three. I actually don't even know when they divorced. I really can't even picture my parents being together at all. They are so different now. I guess that is why I was envious of my friend's family. I never have had a very close relationship with any members of my family. I feel alone inside my parents house. When I went to my friend's house, though, they were always so open with each other and there was never any tension or anxiety between them. I don't see how a family like that could be torn apart, or actually why. Some people think there's a reason for everything, and some people believe that it's all a part of God's plan, but I, personally, have no idea what reason or higher purpose there could be for this man's death. Maybe there isn't any reason. Maybe humans have a natural tendency to search for reasons, causes, purpose. Are we all just misleading ourselves?  Could it be that humans are merely just another species on the face of this planet?  Who knows. James' father knows. He has all the answers to all the questions in life. It's funny that the questions of life are only found in death. He is dead, nevertheless, and I still can't come to that realization. Traumatic experiences just never happen to me or people I know. Until now, I guess. What the hell happened?  Five minutes to go. I remember just before I left, coming back to Austin for my second year, shaking his hand, and hearing him wish me luck. How can that man be dead?  Then I remember that death is a part of living; death is the price tag of life. We all have to face it sometime, and I guess it's not going to happen at our convenience. We have to prepare ourselves for anything, but how?  I don't know of any way I could have prepared for this. If I would have known that he was going to die, I would have tried to stop it from happening. I would have wanted him to keep on living. Why is that?  If death is so common, why do humans try so hard to prevent it, rather prolong it from happening?  I can't say that it's selfishness, I wouldn't want him to live just so I could live happy. But that is a part of it. But, the answer awaits me as well. I guess I'll have to prepare myself for my death. That means I better start living my life. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"     This is kind of new and interesting. I have never done my homework like this before. I accutally tried to get on the computer to do my prescreening, but the computer isn't loading the page so I thought I might atleast complete my writing assignment. Psychology is such an interesting field to study. It is my major in fact at this moment. I don't know if I will change though. The reason why I chose psychology as my major is because my family for a large part suffers from bipolar disorder. I was always told by my parents, since it is genetic, then one day I will have to face the fact that I will also be afflicted with this disorder. With my fate already laid out before me, I thought I might learn more about this disorder and how the brain works in general. I never liked the concept that my destiny is laid out before me. I mean, yes, genetics do play a certain role in who the person I am, but I don't think it determines everything. I guess this is only part of the whole nature-nurture arguement. This experiment reminds me of some sort of journal. I was thinking about starting a journal and writing down all the interesting experiences I go though in my college carrer. I am so lazy though, I know I will fail to write down something one day and one day will turn into two days and then I will probably forget to write in it all together. I know it would be beneficial, both psychologically and emotionally if I were to reflect on everyting, but it seems to me the time spent on writing down all my thoughts is more valuable to me than accually having a journal itself. A dark haired man just sat near me. He didn't sit at the computer directly near me. I wonder why that is? Does he think I smell? Does he think that I will become offened? Does he find me unapproachable? Or is he just scared of women? I never understood the concept really. People tend to perfer to sit with an empty seat between them unless assigned or told to sit next to one another. I do the same sometimes, but other times I sit next to the person anyway. For instance, I sat next the this guy who had a richy-rich hair cut in my psych. class. He wasn't very charming. That's okay because I wasn't interested in him in that context anyway. I tryed to make friendly conversation just for the sake of conversation. I hope he didn't think I was hitting on him because I wasn't. He really isn't my type. He is in the business school. Ehh. I mean nothing is wrong with that I guess, but people who are business majors should just wear a sign saying 'I want money'. Nothing is really wrong with that either because money is good to have, but to focus your life's carrer on that seems kind of mundane. I think money is important, but not as important as knowledge, wisdom, and happiness. I guess it is because I grew up having absolutely no money. People may say they have no money, but really I have no idea how I ate dinner. I was that poor. I think it is because of this, I tend to value education. I look for people who are cultured and knowledgable about soceity. That to me  \"),\n",

       " Document(page_content='As I gaze at the screen I sit and wonder what is the meaning of friendship. This is my main thought at the moment. I\\'ve had rough relationships with friends. To me friends are the kindness that everyone needs. They are around when nothing seems right. They continually partake in your days\\' events. Friends give comfort that no other can give. No matter what the circumstances may be, a friend will always be there for you. Therefore a friend is always ready to lend a \"helping hand\". I guess friendship is a bond between two souls. A friendship is a promise to be \"there\" whenever possible and an understanding of one\\'s feelings. A friend is the one who will help and support you in the pursuit of your dreams and who will only give to your thoughts. In a sense a friend is your shadow only with a mind and a heart. The greater is the heart. For a friend consoles us when in joy or agony. Anything that causes grief or hurt affects our friend. A friend has no materialistic need and can only be repaid with the same truth that is given to you. Friendship is a privilege and a great responsibility. As I write about friendship I think of my friends. One friend comes to mind. She is such a wonderful person. I love her because she accepts me for the way I am. For half my life I\\'ve learned to be scared but with her I know that it\\'s okay to open up. So many things run through my mind that I don\\'t even understand them. Thoughts of hate and confusion run about my mind all the time. It sometimes seems as if time just passes by and I can\\'t stop to take a breath.

       " Document(page_content=\"Hello my name is Joey michael Kindred and I am a biology major. I plan to go to medicall school some day and I hope to become an orthopeodic surgeon. I did not become interested in orthopeodic surgery until I hurt my knee the first game of the football season my senior year in high school. I tore three ligaments and blew seventy percent of my cartilage in my left knee. I used to want to be an orthodontist until this injury but my interests changed with the surgey and all. School is very importtant to me although in high school I can honestly say that I did not try my hardest. I did weell enough to get by and to get into the University of Texas but I did not do my best. From this point forward I strive to be the best that I can be in school and whatever I do so that I can get into a medical school, hopefully somewhere in Texas. I grew up and lived most of my childhood in dallas texas and that is where my dad lives. I have a lot of friends that live there and I really like dallas. It holds  a special place I my heart because of all of my experiences there. I moved to mIdland texas in the seventh grade and went to high school there at midland high. it is really neat to hear you talk about midland, Dr. Pennebaker, in our class. I had many great thigns happen to me while I was in midland and one of those things is my long term girlfriend of five years, Katy Kelly. She means the world to me and I  hope I mean the  world to her. She ended up at texas tech university but hopefully she is going to transfer to UT at the start of next school year for the fall of 2000. I am going to las vegas with her and her family in september for her birthday and I think that will be fun. it will be hot in las vegas and I look forward to seeing the beachboys and Alannis Morisette live at my hotel. I miss her terribly and I haven't seen her since the 20 of August. her mom and dad constantly send me email and little care packages and I hope someday I will marry this girl. I want to live somewhere in the country but somewhere that I don't have to drive that far to work. I want to live outside of a big city because I want to be a weell known doctor that people from all over teh country go to in order to get there bones fixed. that has always been a goal of mine and I plan to carry it out. I hope to have kids someday and raise them the same  way my dad raised me because I can't complain. I grew up in a chrch going family and just came to really know the Lord abotu two years ago. Church is very important to me although I havent found a church here in Austin that I am just wild about. I am a freshman yousee and I havenot been heree that long. that is my life story wrapped up in just a little bit of time but I guess that was my stream of conciousness because that is what I thought about when I was writing. \"),\n",

I came to the conclusion that I didn't need that right now, and that I was only cheating myself by believing this. It is strange because I have such problems with that. I realized recently that I have not reached the belonging. stage of life. Or maybe I reached it by not even trying, when I was very small, but I think ever since school started in kindergarten, as far as I can remember school wise, so maybe I have recessed back under that level of substantial importance. I'm having trouble being myself because I know that I don't even know myself. I do in a sense, but I sometimes think that it is just what I want to tell myself I'm like, and that I try to make myself the person that I think other people will like to see. Then I think that has everything to do with the belonging. factor. I am ultimately working towards self actualization. But I'm trying to be realistic in thinking that it won't be until I'm older like in my thirties. But it doesn't have to be that way. I don't want to feel like I can't do something, but I think how young I am and I think that I'm still just a little kid, and that I will have to work on this a lot more. I don't want to accept myself so I don't let others accept me. Its so hard, and winding. but now I know what I have to do, I have to find what it is that will make me chill out and respect myself and others. This is the key to passing the belonging stage of the cycle towards self actualization. I just need to stop worrying about shit like this and just be happy. And now I know what I have to do. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"I have never considered myself a good student. I never studied in high school, and did not expect anything to change once I got to college. Now I find myself in my dorm doing my homework in advance. I wonder to myself, why? I am not the type of person to do things in advance, but now I am. I think the overwhelming challenge of college has presented itself to me. I used to be the person that would drop anything to go party, but now I'm in Austin, were there are many parties, but I am in my room typing a paper that isn't due until Friday, and it's only Sunday. I think that college has changed my way of thinking and acting, and I want to know why? I find myself wanting to learn, instead of having to learn. The thought that all of this studying will make me a smarter person, instead of just help me pass the test is actually a refreshing one. I still wonder to myself, why is this change happening now? Is it the transition from high school to college what is driving me to be a smarter person? I think that the challenge of studying and making good grades is actually helping me to become a better person. Or am I becoming a better person? Because of so much studying, and the quest for knowledge, I have less time for the people that I love. So is this good for me, or bad for me? Why do I study better when I am back home in Temple, TX? Is it because there are less distractions? In one hand there is Austin, where there is so many distractions, like Sixth Street and parties. In the other hand there is Temple, where all my friends are and all of the hometown parties. I have no idea why I study better when I am at home. I hope these are questions that I can answer after taking this course. I have never wanted any thing as bad as I want a 4. 0 this semester and I don't know why. This is good for me, but why the sudden change. For some weird reason I can not quit asking the question, why do I want to study so much? The key word is want. I do not feel that I have to study, but instead I feel that I want to study. This is such a leap from where I was only a few months ago. Have I done myself harm by changing so rapidly? Will this wear off after I get accustomed to being in college? I hope that it does not, because I like the fact that I want to study and do well in school. Why did I not find this way of thinking in high school? If I had would it have made a difference? I am not sure what made me such a different person in high school, but I would love to know, what was the catalyst behind this tremendous change in my attitude. Is there anyway that I could have caused this change if I had wanted to? I do not think so. The jump from high school to college is what has caused me to be a better student. Why do we as humans look back at things that we have done in the past and wish we could change them? After all it was us that did them. How can we now look back at a situation and make a different decision? I tend to look back and wish to change things, but then I think to myself, that I was the one that made the decision in the first place. I don't know what causes me to look back so often, but I think that I reflect more often then others. Is it because I was happier at the time that I am reflecting? I feel the same know as I always have, but I am a more serious person. I am a happy and easygoing person, by nature, but when I am going to school, I feel more uptight than usual now. I used to look at school as a time to hang out with friends and goof off, but know there is none of that, I am only here for one reason, to do a good job. Hopefully this will carry over to when I get a job and am supporting a family. I think that this attitude will help me to be a very hard worker. I find it relieving to write as I just have for 20 minutes. Actually I went over the time because it was so interesting that I was thinking in this way. I did not know that I had so many questions about myself, until I sat down and wrote about them. I found it easy to ask myself questions without giving answers. Maybe after taking the Psychology class I will be able to answer some of my own questions. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"     Well it is about 1:20 in the morning and i have been up studying for a few of my classes. I keep weird hours on my classes rather than try and make time for them during the day. I guess i enjoy my leisure time as well as my study and i try and make time for both on the weekends. I almost feel like i should have a big sign in my room somewhere saying   hey you should be studying something!   ha. . well maybe not but i like to keep atop of my studies and i don't want to slack off on any of my assignments. The joy i get from lounging around is multiplied by ten if i fall behind on an assignment or if i feel that i might get a   B   or   C   on a test rather than an   A  . I like the fact that i know i will get what i deserve out of my class by what i put into it. So because of this i try and make sure to do the studying. Right now my grades are very important to me. I feel that in the long run they will distinguish me from all the other people who are just trying to get thru college and then maybe find themselves in life. Where as i have already gone the route of finding and exploring myself as well as rationalizing the things i do for quite sometime now. My success i know will not just depend on my degree or simply finishing college but also many other things that i feel i might be able to control. Understanding the aspect of control early on or trying to get a grasp on my life made me realize that there really is no control on life. You must prepare yourself for the best that life has to offer while along the way being happy in the process. Right now it is to be the best that i can be and to get the things i want. So in order for me to do that i must do well in school and in Business. My happiness is might be put off alittle right now by my 15 hours of school but the sacrifice to myself will pay off in the end. It makes me wonder who really is going to read this and what you must be thinking at this point. Ha. . what a character. Well no not really just a determined man. I like doing things that people have told me i had no chance in doing. When i moved here from Colorado i had an agenda and for the last 3 years i have checked off everything that i have set out to do. It gives me comfort in doing what most people can only dream of and never make the attempt or the sacrifice to get it. Blink. blink. don't know. . haha. . Feeling the affects of sleep deprivation right now. . my eyes are feeling alittle heavy and the distant sound of a car alarm is making my mind drift. I see soft white cotton pillows floating around in the back of my mind with baby blue sheets. Man i need to get some sleep. I took this writing assignment as a challenge to be honest and type whatever came into my mind and i guess that this is what i am doing exactly to the   T  . Many different things keep up at night, school, my grandmother in the hospital, the different appointments that i have at school and the week coming up about 9/11. Wondering if my grandmother will be around then and if she is what state of mind will she be in. Which is wrong for me to say seeing as how she just had a stroke and part of her brain is not functioning. The doctors say that she does not feel a thing. I really would like to believe them. It seems unfair that she should live this long (92 years) only to be let to die a little every day. The doctors say that she has a strong heart for age. . well hell we have always known that. . but this one time i wish it was not so strong. . i miss her laughter and knowing that her mental capacity was just as strong as her heart. I miss her already even though i know that she is still with us. Bright red eraser. . why did they make them that color? why not white or blue or yellow on the end of pencils? It seems to me maybe it is the properties of how they make erasers that cause it to be the color that it is. Trying to stay with the typing and trying not to drift off. . i was hoping to get another experiment done after this one but i think that maybe i might try and sleep. I have got to get up earyl and get one of my vehicles registered down town. Maybe that is part of this writing experiment. Have us write this with the knowing that eventually we will turn it into something that we know or think that someone will read. So when we write we eventually get to that point of writing. The mind is laying out a thought process or maybe it is all just random and i am thinking out loud with my keystrokes. I read somewheres that in a thousand years the English language will be dead and that new ways are being created to keep individuals away from any toxic or harmful waste that might be around. So they are trying to create a visual sign for them that will be some kind of universal signal for danger or trouble or death. Hmmm. . seems weird that in time our language might go the way of the Egyptians. . times up. . night. \"),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"Right now i feel as if i need to sleep. Well i at least need to start sleeping on a regular schedule. I have a severe problem with being nocturnal and then not wanting to to anything druing the day ohter than lay around. I think that i am starting to get a little better but i'm not quite sure if i will ever be able to have a good nights sleep. at night. I also and having an interesting time adjusting into school. i have been in school for a year sttraight and I think that i still have   senioritis.   I just don't have the drive to do anything, but i know that i need to get good grades.  I am enjoying my classes this fall much more than the ones that I had this summer. they are actually things that I am interested in and my proffessors are weird or mean like the ones that I had to deal with in the summer semester here. I absolutely love UT, i don't think that there is any way that I could have stayed at home much longer. I'm to the point now that it is really weird whenever i go home and i don't like it very much. I have even started to call austin home. This really bothers some of my friends, mainly the ones who still like back in keller or around keller. I miss my parents a lot and i fell bad that I dislike being at home. I love my mom so much and i worry about her because i know that she is sad. I love my dad too, he and my mom are my favorite people in the whole world and i don't know what i would ever do without them. I feel that i am a disappointment to them though. I am nothing like my sister and i don't have half the book smarts that she does. She got all the intelligence and i got all the common sense, which isnt good when you are going to a school like UT. I love my sister a lot, i just don't know if she likes me that much. We have always had to deal with a lot of sibling rivalry. and you would have thought that it had gotten better but it is just so hard for us to talk sometimes. i think that she is amazing though and i look up to her so much. Right now, I am rally worried about my friend, his dad died not long ago, and i don't know how he is doing. He drinks and smokes all the time and one of his roomates and i are really worried, but it hasnt reached the point where we can say anything to him yet. I think that he would get extremely deffensive especialy if his roomate said something. I really don't know if i can type for another ten minutes, i thought that this time would fly by, but it is actually going really slow. I also don't kow what it is you are expecting from this exercise because i am sure you get a lot of random responses. Anyways, my favorite thing to do in the whole world is Dance. I have been dancing since i was like three and i need to get back into in. Dancing is my utopia and it always makes me feel better. I love everything about it and i know that i need to start taking again before i completely lose the ability. But, it is just so hard to find the time and the money. I need a job if i am going to pay for it and i feel bad asking my mom and dad to pay for it because they are putting so much money into me going to school right now. Aside from my weird sleeping schedule, I also am really weird when it comes to eating. I don't think that I have an eating disorder, but i think that i have something wrong with my stomach that makes me gag, or go through times when i just don't get hungry and the thought of food makes me sick. I think that a lot of my friends worry about me though and think that i am either anorexic or buliemic. I do admit that i am very small, but not discustingly so. I have been living in my apartment for like two weeks now and i have yet to completely unpack my room, this is another example of me being entirely too worthless and having no drive to get up and do something. I know that i will unpack eventually, but i never really see the point. I do love it in my apartment though, my roomates are so cool, and they are really nice to me. I hope that they like me as much as i like them. i am sure that it is kind of weird for them though, like i am invading their territory because, they all knew each other before this and then i moved into the picture. I am going home this weekend for my   boyfriends   birthday. I miss him a lot and i wish that he would transfer to UT. I don't know what is going to happen if we continue fighting like we have been, plus, he just got into a frat, and i don't really like the idea of that too much. I have less than two minutes left and I have absolutely no clue of what to write. I think that after I am done with this I am going to go eat some lasagne. I have a huge craving for it right now for some reason. I think it is because it is five in the afternoon and all i have eaten is fruitloops. Hopefully no one actually reads these assignments because im sure the incessant ramblings of a college student can get kind of redundant and confusing. i know that i would not want that job.  \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"I am going home for the weekend, and I'm wondering what it will be like after being gone for two weeks. I miss home, my friends, my family, everything about corpus christi. I mean, I'm not sad or anything, but I really cannot wait to get there. I'm thinking of how the bus ride will be on the way home, how it is kind of inefficient to take greyhound because of the schedules and long time that it takes to make a relatively short trip. basically, my mind is not thinking about one specific thing. rather, many thoughts are coming to me during the days here at UT. memories of high school, things I did, things I said, just normal context between me and my friends. after not making longhorn band, I often find myself reflecting on band in high school, the band that we all seemed to always be complaining about, but the band that now seems so great to be a part of. I think about being in it, taking solos in jazz band, and that seems to be where I want to be right now, most of the days, that's where I'd like to be. I think about the solos I took on various songs, the ideas I came up with, and the ones I'm coming up with now; I wish I could be in it to play them, I whistle and hum the different rhythms that I would play, my friend and I try to remember all of the songs that we played last year, and the various experiences that came along with performing. I also am thinking about my family and friends, how I miss them, and how I'm going to them this weekend. I think of how I want to be in corpus, and how to make the weekend last as long as possible. I'm trying to think of what to do there, and whether or not I will get to go to laredo to see the football game for my high school. hopefully so. besides that, I think about my sister in Houston, how she's coming to austin this weekend, and how I'm going to corpus this weekend. but I know that we'll see each other soon. I think about my room at home. the food I'm used to eating in corpus, how I really want to eat there because I'm tired of this dorm food. I try to remember as much about home as I can, but there always seems to be more that I think of later. so much complexity about home; however, when I was there before moving up here, sometimes things seemed to boring, but not now. corpus seems like home, because it is. I just can't wait to be there, and I can't wait to go again, hopefully in two weeks. I also think about my classes here, how I'm wondering how I'm going to do in them, if I'm studying enough or writing down the right things in my notes. I hope that I will do good on my first tests, and I hope that the semester is not too hard as long as I study and keep up with everything. I think of my classes at high school, whether I was that smart or not, I wonder if I'm smart enough to be an engineer, I hope that I do not feel inadequate about myself or start feeling like I'm stupid or something. I think all of these thoughts right now, and like I said, they pop in and out of my mind, with no constant or predictable duration or timing. it almost seems like I'm thinking about everything at the same time, and I guess, various specific thoughts become highlighted or standout every now and then, but while I think about everything I can concentrate on one thing while also thinking about everything else too. other than that, my thoughts are pretty much summed up in this paragraph. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"When I first thought about the stream of consciousness writing assignment, I figured my natural stream of consciousness would deliver my views on life and the issues that apply to the everyday. However, all I've been able to think about in the past twenty minutes is a girl. Her name is Kaylee. We became close towards the end of the summer before I came back to Austin. She lives in Dallas so its hard to get to see her very often. One date was all it took. I mean I've known the girl for years, but it became different after this one night. Kind of going from childhood friends to, I don't know, maybe something romantic. If I had known anything was there, I would've stomped on this opportunity a long time ago kind of like if I had known that there were 5 very essential vitamins in California Style Sunny Delight, I would've drunk that my whole life instead of orange juice. When did they come out with Sunny Delight anyways? I don't think it's been around for my entire life but probably pretty close. Possibly when I was five or six years old. At any rate, I always think to myself  could this girl be the one? She's beautiful to start with, and besides that, she's just amazing. I can't spend enough time with that girl. Just going to the playground and swinging with her makes me happy. I got a call from her the other day saying she was going to come see me next weekend. This could possibly be why I haven't been able to get her out of my mind. I really can't wait to see her. Possibly more excited than going to Chile next summer. I'm just packing up my bags and heading down there to see if I can land a job at a local ski resort. I've always wanted to ski bum for a season, so I figured this would be a good chance. And being that the summer in our hemisphere is winter in their hemisphere, it works out  having all summer off. I was actually stressing about this all day being that it has to be in by 5 o clock. I'm leaving for College Station sometime today and I have got so much to do. A police officer gave me a speeding ticket two nights ago on Riverside. Now I have to take defensive driving and get my car inspected to get out of this ticket. And this, piled onto everything else that is going on. I'd say my stress level has recently risen to a 7! Nonetheless, I'm getting out of town this weekend and probably the next too. The swells are getting up to 6 feet on the Texas gulf coast this weekend which is unheard of around here, so I want to get out and catch some waves before they recede. Surfing just makes me relax  puts me in a zone where there are no worries. Soccer doesn't do that for me. I played all my life and it was very fun but also came with a lot of pressure. There were many reasons I guess, but I just played to play, not to win a state championship or anything. Well I guess my twenty minutes are up, time to take a shower! \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The reality that college isn\\'t just one continuous party is finally beginning to set in now that I have chpaters of information to read in all of my classes. I think somewhere in my mind I thought that college would be easier and less stressful than high school because it seems like there\\'e more free time. Well, I know now that this will not be so. All my free hours during the week will be full of reading, studying, writing, reading, studying, writing. I\\'m really afraid that I won\\'t know what to expect on examinations. I\\'ve spent about an hour reading twenty pages out of my psychology book and can\\'t imagine what I\\'m going to do. Reading and reading gets so boring, except when the material is very interesting. I also started reading my Economics, and enjoyed reading the parts that I recognized as being covered in class. I\\'ve discovered that going out every night and staying out until 2:00 a. m. is not going to cut it. The first week of school I tried this and could hardly stay awake during class. There are lots of pressures both externally and internally to go out and \"party\" and meet people every night. Externally, I\\'m a member of a sorority and we\\'re supposed to party a lot with our sorority sisters. Internally, I feel like I\\'m missing out or something if I don\\'t go. Maybe there\\'s a cute guy out there just waiting for me to meet him, yeah right. I ran into this guy randomly on the street outside of UTC that I had met at Orientation. We recognized eachother and talked for a minute. A couple days later I saw him in my EConomics class. It would be so cool if some how we were to start talking or something. But, great things like that usually don\\'t happen to me. My roommate and friend across the hall both make fun of me for having such a crush on this guy. I really like them a lot. We all got so lucky with the girls staying in our hall. Everyone is so nice and we get along well. I especially like my roommate. We have the same interests, likes, and dislikes. We aren\\'t in the same sorority which kind of makes me sad, but we still do stuff together.

       " Document(page_content=\"     Ok, writing. I started this a few minutes ago but apparently in Mozilla Firefox the timer doesn't work. Sorry if I end up submitting two essays. Right now I'm kind of hungry. My stomach is growling, I haven't eaten since seven-thirty this morning. I didn't use to eat breakfast, but now I do. One minute down. I feel pressured, like I have to continue hitting keys or I'm not doing as well as I should on this writing assignment. Which is strange because all I have to do is write something, anything, and I get credit for it. Is it cheating if I use the backspace key to edit my mistakes?  There are quite a few of them. I probably would type better and therefore faster if I slowed down, which is paradoxical but true. I am also sleepy. Maybe I will take a nap, except I have to study. Hooray. That's a thing about college that is hard to get used to - setting oneself to a schedule and keeping to it, studying and going to classes on time without being told what to do. I'm thinking about psychology and the hypothalamus, which is what we learned about yesterday. The description of the rat kind of makes me wish I was a rat whose hypothalamus was being zapped. Seems kind of nice, although dying of starvation doesn't sound pleasant. Maybe in this case it does. I wonder what it's like. Maybe conscious though takes a backseat to simple feelings of pleasure, like humans feel sometimes, in the throes of ecstasy (religious, sexual, or chemical). Maybe the human brain has a natural resistance to feeling too much for too long in order to protect itself from things like dying of pleasure. Quite a way to go. I am running out of things to write about and it's only been 5:30 minutes. My mind is becoming a blank. Perhaps I can shove something in there. Nope. Rub a dub dub, three men in a tub. I'm regressing back to childhood, oh no!  Forced constant thinking seems to have brought me back to my childhood, which is not what I would have expected. If you think about it, that nursery rhyme is kind of suggestive. I wonder why I keep bringing up images and thoughts from when I was young?  Perhaps those, being learned first, form the basis of the psyche and are therefore more intrinsic to the mind than say, what I learned yesterday or what I see on MTV. MTV. I do not like that channel at all. I do not like it in a boat, I do not like it with a goat. I do not like it, Sam I Am, I do not like Music Television. The channel that proclaims to be that of rebels and anti-culturalists, but is really the mainstream mass-produced mass-consumed product that everyone thinks it is rebelling against. At least they encourage people to vote. That's a positive message coming from a negative source. I guess no one or nothing is truly evil. Well, nine minutes gone. I'm feeling stretched, like butter spread over too much bread, as Bilbo put it. Like everything in my mind has already come out and I'm squeezing a juicebox trying to suck the dregs of thought through that straw. Of course, with a juicebox you can never quite get out all the liquid, and I suppose it's the same with the mind. One thing I never understood about the mind is how one gets from neurons firing and connecting with each other to actual consciousness. In the textbook it seems like a step is skipped. An analogy can be made (and has been, I assume) between the mind and the computer. One could say, well, magnetic information doesn't seem at first glance to represent data and images and text. But the former is converted into the latter by programs, which themselves run on magnetic data. Where are the programs in the mind?  It's hard to believe that the human mind just coincidentally has the neurons in all the right patterns to be able to form speech and thought and movement. Where is the software?  I'm just rambling now. Although that's the purpose of this paper, isn't it?  Ha ha. I tried to read the book House of Leaves, I was told it was brilliant, but you know what?  It, for lack of a better and more descriptive and more culturally acceptable word, sucks. It's written in a nonfiction style, but the endless footnotes serve only to distract from character development and this won't make much sense to whoever is reading this if they haven't read it. Speaking of which, Hello, whoever is reading this!  I hope you're having a wonderful day. Although reading hundreds of stream of consciousness papers is not my idea of a wonderful day. Still, someone's got to do it, right?  Someone's got to do all the dirty jobs in the world, until they design an automated way to do it. Then the worker loses their job. Which is better, I wonder-- working at a terrible job, or being replaced from that terrible job and not working at all?  Some day, hopefully, we will have robots to do all our terrible jobs for us. We will become like Asimov's Solaria - thousands of robots to maintain a small human population. Eventually it will go to extremes -- millions of robots to one human. Or maybe not. What will be the point of civilization then?  What is the point of it now?  To keep people happy?  Great job so far, I must say. Nowadays people think that what they need to be happy is chemicals. More and more chemicals, pills, etc. to cure the imbalances in their head. They should take a cue from computer repair people -- the problem is just as often in the software as in the hardware!  Biological psychology will go a great deal in explaining human behavior, but it can only go so far. People who have no imbalance in their minds but still do terrible things or get depressed - what do we do with them?  Eighteen minutes, fifteen seconds have passed. Quite a while to be writing. You know, a second never seems so long as when you want it to be short. I love time's relativity, even though this isn't really an application of it. If only there was a way to have time speed up or slow down if we wanted it to -- now there would be a best-selling invention. It all deals with people's perception anyway -- I bet there is a way, somewhere. Although messing with brains like that probably isn't a good idea. Speaking of good ideas, my time is just about up.

       " Document(page_content=\"I'm wondering just what the point of this is. this is really boring,       I wish I had something to eat, it's getting close to dinner time, maybe      if I turn on the stereo this won't be so bad. it's really hot in my dorm room, this is still as boring as ever. I don't know how I'm going to     be able to keep this up for twenty minutes. I can't help but stare at the     posters to kill time. I'm particularly fond the print of Monet's sunset at Venice. There are so many things I'd rather be doing right now, like watching TV or sleeping. Well I'd much rather this have been a 5 minute stream of consciousness writing, since 6 minutes has lapsed. I wonder     just how many of these the professor/TA's actually read. I know I wouldn't want to have to read any of these. Hopefully I did well on my biology test I took today. Tomorrow is my birthday and hopefully that will be cool. I still have a lot of reading to do tonight, which I will more than likely put off until sunday. Only ten minutes has gone by so far. this is incredibly boring, but at least it's not all that difficult. I thought last class's discussion was very interesting, however gruesome some of the experiments on the mice seemed. I can hear people talking out side. Normally I would find this disruptive, but now it's welcomed as it helps me think of more to write about. I wish I had a laptop so that I could type this elsewhere, and I think the heat from my computer contributes to my room's excessively high temperature. I wish I could go to the game saturday, but I didn't get a ticket. Last week's game was really exciting. Only one more minute. I just wish this were over with. I can't help but notice how disorganized my desk is, even this early in the school year. I can hear music playing in the next room. I wish my stereo system was that loud. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"I'm still trying to figure out why I always procrastinate. I think I like to work under pressure, I have a philosophy paper due in a couple hours. I wonder if this class is going to be hard, or easy as long as you read and listen. I hope the second because I have never been one to study, and I would prefer not to now. why do people go home on the weekends? I thought that was what college is all about, going out on your own, more independence. calculus is going to be difficult this semester, I can already tell I'm going to have to do the homework in there. microecon shouldn't be too bad, I already covered most of the material in high school. if there's one thing in life I want to accomplish it is to understand what girls think, and what they mean by what they say or by their actions. I'm hoping this class well help me in that pursuit. its like you could be best friends, always hanging out have a great time, and think there's something there, but she just is gone for a while then. I'm still interested in this sleep deprivation thing. I read that some guy did an experiment on himself and stayed awake for over a hundred hours. after that everyone he saw he thought was Satan or the grim reaper or something like that. I think that would be an interesting experience to have, hallenacion and what not. I hope bush wins the election, although my family is die hard republican, I am more agree with things from both sides, with a slight lean to republican. I just believe bush will do a lot better job than Kerry, and the whole Vietnam thing I just don't was right. its funny how people can overreact and stereotype. there is currently a couple of bills in congress trying to resurrect the draft for military and civil service. while I don't know everything about it, I was looking over it and it appears to be supported by democrats. and the people I heard about it from were complaining that bush was the one that is trying to do it. I just hate it when people don't get their facts straight before they try and argue things, it just makes them look stupid. poker is a fun little game. I wish I could play it more often. trying to read people, and make decisions based on their actions and words. I wish I could find a girlfriend. there are many beautiful girls down here, but I don't know about some of them. there was this awesome beautiful girl at home, but I don't really know what happened there, I guess that goes back to understand what is going on in a woman's brain. I realized 20 minutes is a lot longer than you think it is, or maybe it is just appearing to be longer because I am thinking about how long it is, or I'm not doing an activity I find to be exciting. figuring a person out by the music they listen to is a fun activity. its hard because some people listen to all types of music. coffee is a life saver, going to sleep at 4 or5 then having class at 8 the next morning is not fun, I'm surprised I woke up for it. I missed class the other day when I slept through it and it was at 12. that's just strange, getting up at the 8 one, but oversleeping the 12. I wonder what the real world has in store for me, no more school and someone there to help. but as one professor I met said, remember these days, these are heaven. because after school you are going into hell. which I would agree with although I haven't experienced life after school, but I think it will be hell. \"),\n",

I have to call about volunteering and for sure email Anne to see if they have a Physical Therapy program at her hospital. How will I get this stuff done. I am torn as to whether or not to join a Fraternity. I think I will, I just hope I have time to get my studies done. As well as time to myself. I really need to get my bike back from Maggie\\'s apartment. I\\'m sure it\\'s getting to be a bit cumbersome there. Sometime tomorrow I have to find a way to get to the mall and buy some clothes. I need 2 ties, a new pair of khaki pants, some dress shoes and other miscellaneous things. I am so glad I changed my class schedule. It will be so much better this way. I am so stressed out about physics. I so hope I at least make a \"B\" in there. Pray, oh pray. I should make it to the BSM Thursday evening and check that out. I am sure there are some good looking ladies there. I can\\'t believe the Horns lost. What the heck?  To N. c. State. They better come back and win this week against Stanford. Actually we need Ricky back. Another thing is I need to wash my car. It\\'s pitiful!  Definitely get the golf clubs out of my car. Or at least relocate them to a more convienient place. I seriously hope things go well with the Fraternity. I mean that is a lot of $$$. Campus looks nice tonite. I love the tower. I think I like college football way better than pro. It has so much more of an aura to it. The pros don\\'t have any spirit. The college game is where it\\'s at. I wonder where my roomate is. That punk never tells me when he\\'s leaving. I still have to do the pretest. I tried, but it gave me some gateway server error message. I need to make sure and read for History and Government. I hope this Thursday schedule is going to work. I am starting to get a hint of missing my friends, but nothing like I thought it was going to be. Actually pretty good. Oh man, I just got an Instant Message. Oh well, I really need to finish this assignment. I kind of like this. Let\\'s me get my feelings out. I need to find a Church for sure. I haven\\'t been reading my Bible like I should since I got to Austin. I really need to work on that. I wonder what the rest of the year is going to be like. This move from a JUCO college is a bit extreme. Nothing like high school to college, but I went from a college with  5,000, to a college of 50,000. I probably have met 200 people so far. I am so terrible with names. I really need to work on that. My suite mates are being loud. Makes me not want to study. Or at least go elsewhere. I should probably check out the UGL or PCL anyway. I bet I could do a better job there in the first place. So what am I going to do this weekend?  It being Labor Day, I kind of have a choice. I might go to Houston to visit my Sister or might stay and go to the lake with  Richie and Jason. I really miss my folks. Way more than I expected. I hope I get over it soon. I need to email some people and say hi before too much longer. I wonder what my new Physics prof is going to be like?  Good or Bad?  Nice or Unpleasant?  What?  I need to start praying more. Maybe that will help me with my confidence and focus. Whatever happens, I need to call Gina tonite and line everything up for tomorrow night. This class schedule is going to be so much easier!  I love it!  No Friday school!  Three day weekends for a whole semester. I hope my TTH classes aren\\'t too strenuous all together. This is my first time to really balance 3 classes like that. '),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Right now i am simply writing and not feeling anything in particular. I am somewhat upset right now though because my throat is hurting, and this is due to the fact that i have started smoking a lot more than usual. I am a pretty sensitive person so i think that is why it hurts. who knows. I also am feeling a little unmotivated at the moment and i can't figure out why. This is the time in life when i am supposed to be super juiced to go out and get what i want, to grab life by the horns so to speak. This is not happening though, and it is kind of scary. Throughout my life i have been pretty much handed everything i have either through the mediocrity of others or through my own natural abilities, or a combination of both. It scares me to think that i have never applied myself fully to anything that i have ever done, and have still managed a somewhat successful, although underachieving, life. It makes me wonder a few things though about myself and what i have in store for the rest of my life. I don't know if i actually know how to apply myself fully to something, and if i do will i actually be able to stop and apply it to something else. This not only applies to me with work and school but also with personal relationships. Up to this point I have many friends, but very few whom i can actually call close friends. They are just there because of attrition or because i was what some people might call popular in high school. I wasn't popular because of my stunning personality though, but more of what i was;  a basketball player, an intelligent person, and somewhat goodlooking. When i got to college and found that there are hundreds if not thousands of people like this i found out that i am not at all who i thought. I don't really know who i am and who im not, and i am kind of scared to try to find out. When i finally decide what i am will i like it?  Will anyone else like me?  Will it make me happy or will i learn to hate myself because i disdain the person that i actually am. They say that you can be whoever you want but this is not true. You can TRY to be whoever you want but for some reason you cannot always be this way because there is something deep down inside of you that knows better. If i try to be a suave cool underpressure type guy, but fall down a lot, it doesn't really fit. I can want to be that way so badly, but it may never come true. If I accept that fact that i am a goofy dork will I like what that will get me. I am going out on a limb here and saying that women aren't exactly falling all over themselves for goofy dorks. At least not ones that i have met just yet. Perhaps this is just society pulling on me, and i should just accept whatever i am. The true question how do you find out who you are?  I want to know so bad that it hurts, but there is not equation to find out. You just have to go out there and do it, and I am too scared to do it. I don't want to end up like the rest of my family, just sitting around waiting, feeling sorry for myself. I feel so much safer and better though when i just stay within myself and don't wander out of my comfort zone. My guess is when you do the wandering is when you find out who you really are. I don't see the oppurtunities yet. I am still waiting and wondering, hoping. I guess if i knew how to talk to people better than it would be easier to find out who i am. When i talk to people though its like they want to get away from me as fast as they can. They look down on me and they don't even know me. I don't understand why this is, but i am afraid that it is because of   who i am  . I think i am doomed to always be this way, and it scares me. I don't want to  be this way. I am too needy for random people to want to be my acquantance, friend, what have you. I expect too much too fast and it scares people fast. People accepted it in the past because they   wanted   to be my friend because of who i was, but alas now that is not the case. So now im stuck, clutching onto the past like a has been with no real hope of ever stretching out and completing myself. Then i will be like the rest \"),\n",

I don't know though but I'm glad tim called me yesterday. the flowers aunt michelle sent me are getting old where should I put them, I guess in the waste basket thing by the stairs. I wish I could use those but every time I go down for lunch you can't get in from that staircase, its annoying. I'm really hungry. I was not supposed to eat the snickers and kit kats but I mean I practically had vegetables for lunch so its ok, plus its the weekend soon and I don't want to waste it. I forgot to go draw my tickets, I never know when to go. I should look it up soon but I can't go now because sunny and abbey have not given me their IDs and its probably too late anyway. and lets see only like an hour till psychology, I want to sleep but ate the candy so I'd stay awake and its working I mean I'm a little tired but not too much. I went to bed around like 1 last night but I wanted to study more, but my roommate was sleeping and she gets mad or annoyed sometimes when I turn on the light, like its a spotlight on her or something. anyway kinda pisses me off and I have to do everything in the dark which takes forever, I have to brush my teeth, take my pills, do my nose drops, lots of stuff. and then she wakes up really early - well she had a class, but she didn't wake up to her alarm and I did. and then when she left it went off again and I still had an hour to sleep before I had to get up to get dressed. it was cool though. my room is nice and clean now, the maid lady came because she forgot to come yesterday. I can't really do this if my roommate is in here, oh well. she is about to come in, I hope I can focus! this is really hard to think of things to say because I have never really paid attention to my stream of consciousness. I don't know if I'll be able to draw my tickets tomorrow because my classes are in the morning and I don't know what time it closes. probably all sold out anyway, so many people here. but its funny because I'm not meeting as many people as I'd like to, but I have only gone to like one frat so. I'm glad I met tim though, that was kind of random and he is really cute. and abbey seems to like mike, who really likes her, and they would be cute too. but abbeys is either changing a lot or living a lie, she goes to frats like 4 times a week, its crazy. and I have been friends wither her for like 10 years so I know she procrastinates so I hope she gets her work done. I don't think she is though because she always says she has hw and then leaves to go party or something, whatever though. we might go get coffee later at barnes n noble, its such a far walk. I don't need coffee either but I think abbey thinks I'm mad at her so I'm going to go anyway and just study I guess. I mean I knew college was a lot of studying but I didn't think it'd be this much. maybe because I'm such a slow reader. I only read about 20 pages per hour. and in the textbook its only 10 per hour. its so slow and so many pages. I finally finished the psychology homework like 2 hours ago, it was sort of interesting but I hope the next chapters are better. I don't think I'm retaining anything. which is bad because I read for so long that you'd think I'd be learning it. I get psychology confused with philosophy and then can't seem to remember either of them. but in class I listen and I get it, then after I try to think about it and all my classes run together. yesterday was especially bad because I got my first grade on a calculus homework assignment. I made a 71 and it really pissed me off because I worked so hard and asked the teacher assistant for help but he gave me the wrong answer and I trusted it. he also didn't do some examples on the board correctly, which made me get another one wrong. today he was all ?oops? yeah it made me mad. but oh well I can drop it according to the syllabus that I don't have printed out. I hope whoever reads this does not think I'm a psycho or anything, or can't spell because its either a typo or I just don't spell well. I really am a good student though and I'm really sad about the calculus hw because it was my very first college grade and I have been waiting for all my hard work to pay off, and it sucked. I was in the bathroom at kerby lane and I cried when I told my dad, I always do that. its good that I have bangs now because if I were to cry or not pluck which I need to do, you can't tell that much. I'm funny about crying, I do it when something really touches my heart, which is kind of often I guess. but pain wise I'm pretty tough, I played basketball for so long. I'm so accident or injury prone. I swear I always get hurt. at the football game that hurt so much when I stepped on that glass I think there was still some in my foot but beth said there was not. it does not hurt anymore so that is alright. I just hope everything goes well for me I mean I really wanted a 4. 0 gpa but now I'm scared. maybe being scared will hinder my performance, so ill stop worrying about it and just trust that I'm smart enough. twenty minutes is almost up. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"I am feeling very confused at this point in my life. I am thinking about my future and my career.

I am glad that I came to this school because if my parents had made me go to a smaller, local university then I would have always wondered what it would be like to come here.

       " Document(page_content=\"I'm feeling a little tired right now. I usually don't suffer from severe lack of sleep as I have this weekend. It's pretty interesting the way it affects my ability to concentrate. I feel like I don't read as well or  communicate ideas as well. This is really a weird assignment but I feel  like I would be taking the easy way out if I were to sit here and dwell  on that for twenty minutes so here goes. Someone is tapping on a table  or something in the next room. I hate it when people make a big ruckus  doing something like that and then they can't even keep a beat. Something I think is interesting is the way people can become dependent on new  technology in a matter of months. When my roommate and I first moved here to Austin we didn't have e-mail capabilities at first and I felt  completely cut off from the outside world. I was so relieved when we  were finally back online. I just figured out what that tapping was. It's  my roommate playing electric bass but it's not plugged in so there isn't  much pitch distinction. Like I always say: bass should be felt not heard. Speaking of my roommate, everyone has told me that it's a bad idea to live  with a friend at college and I think they were right. It's not that I don't like the guy. It's just that his annoying traits got magnified tenfold as  soon as we moved into a 15 foot by 8 foot room. Some friends came down from my hometown this weekend. Their visit made me  realize that as soon as I left for college, everything changed. Most of my relationships with people have been faded a little by the move and I'm sure it's an ongoing process. There are a couple of people, however that I actually feel closer too and surprisingly they're not here in Austin with me. I'm still trying to understand that. I guess when you're separated  from people by large distances, you kind of sort things out in your head and figure out who and what is important. It's like post traumatic  prioritizing.

       " Document(page_content=\"In this present moment I feel slightly irritated due to the fact that earlier  today I was not able to surf the internet on America Online. The problem of surfing the internet could have been easily solved by going to a computer lab  in my dormitory(Jester) and logging on to the internet from there. However. my focus was to locate some friends on the internet. This feature is exclusive to America Online and not possible to achieve in the Jester Computer lab. Ultimately I gave up and now I am in the process of typing this 'stream of consciousness'. Another issue on my mind. even though it may sound trivial is table tennis. Earlier in the day my friends and I were unable to get an open table which irritated me. Truthfully, I will admit that I am fairly easily irritated. I think that a large blame on this problem rests on my tendency to be a perfectionist. When things do not get done, or do not get done the way that I want. I get really irritated.   On a good note, one good aspect about myself is that I realize my shortcomings. I am trying my best to overcome these bad tendencies that I have. In my opinion, college means to me a clean slate in which I can start over. I am trying my best to get off and remain on the right foot. One of my foremost goals is to meet new colleagues and friends. Friendship is very important to me. Without friends. the road of life would be lonely indeed. Whether these friends are so called 'e-friends' that I keep in touch with over the internet, or friends I know in person. they are equally important.   While I am on the 'e-friend' topic. I feel compelled to mention an incident that happened to me on the internet. I met a nice female an America Online. Considering that America Online is the largest internet provider in the world. I was very surprised that this person  happened to live in close proximity of me. We set up a rendezvous at a coffee  house in which we met in person. We had a good time. This just shows how the world is smaller than it seems. In addition. I also keep in touch with e-friends in such places and Germany and Singapore. It is very interesting to converse with them.    As you can probably tell. I am very much a technophile. I love anything electronic and I especially love computers. But of most importance to me as I mentioned already are friends. I guess I could say the prevalent topic in this 'stream of consciousness' is friendship. To tell the truth. if any of my e-friends were severed from my acquaintance, be it by losing touch or just plain not talking to me any more, I would be extremely upset. However. I know it cant last forever. Sometimes it seems that nothing will last forever. I guess sometimes we just have to move on. \"),\n",

My mom, sister, and I are best fri3nds, and it's is pretty hard because I can't just pick up the phone and call them. It took a couple of day for me to realize this. I also have a boyfriend back home. This has also been hard. It's been hard for both of us. We were in the habit of talking everyday, and seeing each other quite often, now he's three hours away. I think he's taking it a little harder than I am. I'm keeping busy so I'm not constantly thinking about him. There's so much going on here. Between keeping on top of all of my classes, and hanging out, there's no more time left in the day. We've been having so much fun. The other five girls I hang out with are great. We all bonded so quickly. They really help to keep me focused on what I need to do. Of coarse with a group this big personalities flare, and we have disagreements, but surprisingly instead of holding grudges we talk it out. Females are stereotyped as being gossipy, and shady. Yes we do gossip, but if we say something behind someone's back, you can guarantee it's already been said to their face. So far everything's been going pretty smoothly. I hope this bond that is present now remains present for the next four years. It's difficult to say if it will because we can't  predict the future, and people change. When we're just sitting around we talk about our future as friends. I've already asked them to be bridesmaids at my wedding. Who knows when that will be. I don't plan for it to be any time soon, but I do hope our friendship will at least last that long. Friendship is a very important thing to me. It gives a sense of warmth, and belonging. It's like we have known each other for years. I hope nothing, but good will come out in due time. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='first of all I don\\'t have set prison like rules and regulations. the classes are a lot more laid back and I can do self paced. high school was much more busy work which was crap. I am worried however about how well I do in college. although I did well high school, college is much different. rather than burning the info into you through busy work and assignments, we have to learn on our own. everybody says that they learned more their freshman year than in all of high school. seeing as how I cram all my assignments into the night before it\\'s due, I plan to change dramatically on how my work is done. the influence of my friends also worries me. because of the many groups of friends I don\\'t think I\\'ll have much time to do studying or productive work. I am hoping that by writing all of this down, I am able to recognize my weaknesses and change them before they do any great harm. since this is stream of consciousness I can\\'t help but write about the catcher in the rye, one of my favorite books. since I\\'m in psychology, I hope that doesn\\'t mean that I\\'m going to assassinate any powerful people. the book is great written in stream of consciousness and I feel many of holden\\'s feelings. such as the phoniness in society. the phonies in society really piss me off!  back to college, I hope that I can discipline myself and succeed in college. right now I\\'m listening to red hot chili peppers. I don\\'t know what that tells about me, but I love their older songs. I can make disappear have no fear! music is my airplane, is my airplane. rrahhh!  four more minutes. I don\\'t know what to write. I have so many thoughts but they\\'re not organized. sex of course is on my mind, and since it\\'s the first day of class, that\\'s on my mind. the crazies passing out the Christian leaflets is also on my mind. it really pisses me off. not that their spreading the word, because I\\'m catholic. what pisses me off is that they\\'re so hypocritical. they go out preaching but then turn around and drink it up (under age) and sleep around (pre marital sex!)  that disgusts me. although I do drink a little, I don\\'t go out preaching. many of my friends are atheists and agnostic. I view many of their views such as religion\\'s role in being a social and moral standard. after all, if there was no fear in sinning  then crime would skyrocket and the moral stability  of society would disappear. while that is true, not all will revert to barbaric life. while there are laws, religion adds more to the discipline in obeying the basic commandments. we\\'ve had hours and hours of discussion on religion and god. from these discussions I see that many misinterpretations of the catholic faith exist. for example, many believe that (through the narrow-mindedness of the teachers of their religion) that Catholics worship Mary when in fact we pray through her. they see that as a way of discrediting Catholicism by pointing out verses in the bible stating that \"thou shall worship no other god than me\"  or something like that.

       " Document(page_content=\"It is the first time that I have done this and I don't think it is at easy as it sounds. For though there are no mathematical equations to solve I do think it is pretty hard to keep on writing without stopping for such a great amount of time (20 minutes is a lot of time) I don't really know what to keep on writing, since right now I am just worried about the fact that this are going to be the longest 20 minutes of my life. I have just received and email of my cousin and I'm so glad because she is now working and it makes me think how great it would be for me to get a job, since today I went again, to speak to the person in charge in the cactus caf칠 and no one was there, and the girl told be that there were no open jobs and specially not at the time that I need. I really want to work because I don't want to spend more money given to me by my parents since I'm fully aware that they need it for things far more important that what I am using the money for (clothes, food, personal expenses in general. When the eternal 20 minutes go by I shall reply to my cousins email and express to her the great gratitude I feel towards her email since at the present time she has been one of the only people in my family, which have supported us in this time of nee. This is really hard for me because I feel like I'm writing like a two year old since this isn't my native language. It would be so much more comfortable if I could write in my language, since when my mind is working it is usually processing information in English. Right now the phone is ringing and I guess this is Jorge since he said he was going to call. I really hope its not anyone from home for I would be really disappointed and sad if they called and me being here did not pick up the phone just because I am doing this stupid homework which at the time seems pretty irrelevant, to what I am feeling at the present time. I am just repeating myself and a set of common American expressions that come to my mind, this is pretty stressing because I want to look at the monitor and check out how much have I written and specially I want to check out the timer. for I have taken a cooking timer to control my minutes typing so that I wouldn't have to stop to watch the clock. While typing other thoughts go past my mind but they are probably in Spanish and I am probably just ignoring them so that I don't make typos, this makes me think of my stupid physics teacher, I'm so glad I don't have to take any more physics in my whole life. I don't really know what I want to study, each time I go to the introduction to psychology class my mind plays tricks on me and I start visualizing myself in various occupations and I'm not quite sure of which one truly fits me. I couldn't resist so I took a look at the timer and I just realized that only ten minutes have passed and they have passed so slowly, its like when you are up at night not being able to sleep and scared of the dark and listening to the clicking of the clock and time just passes so slowly. Well I would just like to get it over with since I am basically trashing 20 minutes in front of this computer not doing any real thinking or insight process but just mechanically typing and typing and typing and when I make a mistake I just press the backspace and keep on going. Well since I don't know what else to say I'll keep on exploring my thoughts related to my future and my career. I think a really important issue is due to me, going to this jerk astronomer who separated my life into two: before and after I went. I am really worried of what he said dealing with marriage and divorce, it has always been a fear I have had and that day he just said it to me as if nothing was the matter. And of course something is the matter because once they tell you something like that you won't be able to forget it ever. Also what he said about me having problems with my baby like miscarriages or stuff well I think he shouldn't have said that either. I wish I could have entered the business school since I would be having a respectable title of a carrier but since I didn't then I just en up having all these classes, which I really enjoy but which are making me feel more confused. I really like the university and the classes and the teachers, but I haven't made many friends and although I know it has nothing to do with my self worth I do feel a little upset because I have been hirer for over three weeks and still I don't feel like I have a lot of friends. I just took a look at the watch and I think this is finally it! \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"I forgot that we were going to be timed, I wonder if we have to type well, I wonder if everything has to be in complete sentences or even have the correct use of grammar. This is kind of harder than I thought. So should I go back and re-write my first phrases in complete sentences? Oh well, I don't think I will. I'll just keep going. I need to keep typing about something. I need to type what I'm feeling. I'm feeling a little stressed because I have to keep typing all this time. I wonder how long this should be, especially if I have to keep typing for a whole twenty minutes. It's only been three minutes. Geez! I thought this was going to be an easy assignment. Well, it is relatively easy. It's just different from what I expected. I wonder if sarah and Christen have gone to bed yet. I never know how late they stay up because I'm always. oh my phone is ringing! But I can't pick it up because I have to keep typing. Oh well. They can wait. I bet it's Larry. I still haven't met him. But Liz said he wasn't even that cute. He is a sophomore though, so he has at least been interesting to talk to over the phone. I need to call Jennie and make sure we can all go out on Friday night. My shoulder is sore. I wish I was a professional athlete who received massages after working-out. That would be so nice. I can't believe I ate those Tiffany's Treats cookies. I hate that. It takes so much energy for me to get motivated to walk all the way over to the gym and then run three miles. But then I just come home and waste all of the calories I burned off on cookies. I wonder why I get those cravings for sweets. I keep thinking that it would be so easy for me to just cut out all sweets from my diet. I'm running around the track in such pain. I really hate to run. Well, I guess I don't hate it. It does feel good at times, like after you're done and you've accomplished three miles. But while in the middle of the actual running it feels so hard! It takes a lot of mental strength as well as physical strength because you just keep thinking about how much nicer it would be to just stop. I wonder who is actually going to read this? I hope no one expects me to be a proliferated prowess. I don't know if that even makes sense. Natalie, my friend at BYU wrote that today in her email. I have such respect for people with an abundant vocabulary. I feel that way mostly because I lack the. see I can't even think of the words. I lack the ability to think of the words. The bottom line is I need to work on my vocab because I just don't have that thirst for expanding my vocab unlike Natalie. However, I did pick up a pocket dictionary and a thesaurus while I was getting my school supplies. I realized that my spelling abilities were quite embarrassing. But then ironically when I finally took the time to look up certain words for their correct spelling, I couldn't find them in my dictionary! I never look words up because I just lacked the motivation and then when I finally tried to change my ways and be picky and start paying attention to details, like how words were spelled, they weren't in the dictionary! It just goes to show that I can try but I'm pretty sure that there will never be a drastic change in my abilities to spell or expand my vocabulary. Maybe I need to read more. I need to read the newspaper everyday. I hated hearing that I had to pick up and read a news paper for my government class. My neck still hurts. I need a massage. I would love to just get massages all the time. That would be so nice. I only have two minutes left. It feels like I haven't been typing for very long. I think typing messages to my friends on instant messenger has made me a better typer. I still can't type very fast. almost done. 30 seconds. wow this is a long 10 seconds. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"I know that I have assignments to take care of but I do not want to complete them. I know it is incredibly important for me to perform these tasks. they can make or break my future. yet, I still never seem to be able to motivate myself. it is really frustrating sometimes. But that  is were the apathy sets in again and I will not take action. It seems like a cycle that I know at my house. My dad had behavior problems, to put them modestly, I could see how it would pain him, he did want to change, but it was as if he never followed through. I do not blame  him, I just see a pattern that is similar to mine. But at least I am working now. I still have German 506 to complete that is were I am most suffering. I need to review, and starting to catch up before I wind up failing. It would b e the realization of possibly my worst nightmare. Me being my only downfall, or rather me causing my own downfall. At some point I have to break this cycle but sometimes I don't think I will. But I must press on. If I don't turn it around, on my own now that I am in college, I am afraid I never will , and all the jokes about the weeding out process catching me will actually materialize. I have to start putting my foot down. Tonight was a good start. I told my suite mate who I am very good friends with that I could not go see a band play with him. instead I opted to stay home and do work. However, only now I am beginning to work on it. That is very disappointing . It seems as if it will be another late night, another example of destructive behavior. I will go home this weekend and perhaps seeing all my old friends and especially my parents will provide both some moments of relaxation and clarity for realizing the importance of my task at hand. It will be very nice to get away. The depravity of this city seems to be catching me. Or rather I am slowing down to let it get me. Waco is a much different society than Austin. I cannot be lure d away. Then again that is a mistake for me to blame this city. Waco has all the same trappings, I just had a strict support system to keep me from falling . Now I can fall and It doesn't look that I will stop. I cannot think like that. But any rate, it will be nice to see the old friends and parents and perhaps be able to better take in my first 3 weeks of college and that way tell what all indeed I need to work ion to improve myself. I just know that this cannot go on or I will star5 to pay some very hefty consequences. My dad always told me before I left for UT that I would be greatly affected t by the people I surround myself with. I can see how this is partly true but I do not think they will control my pattern of thinking or my priorities. I will start breaking from their carelessness now and develop my own work habits. I will be in control of what it is I will do on any given evening instead of bowing to my lethargy and trying to relay on some mythical easy way out to appear. This is the time for me to start caring. I am not sure what else I can talk about. I have run the gamut with those previous thoughts and to talk of them more would just seem to be beating a dead horse. My mind is almost weary from thinking about the subject and I need an escape. Perhaps it is the midnight hour approaching that is getting to me. I don't believe that I have  much longer to continue writing on this assignment. Two very large priorities for the even9ihng that I still have to take care of is my German, which I have already stressed the importance of, but also washing clothes because tomorrow I return to work and I need better clothing than what I am wearing, or have been wearing for the past two days. It may seem late, but if I am outrunning that new leaf, I am going to have to start somewhere, and if not now, when. My mind is growing blank and I believe that I should rest before going on to the next assignment so as not to be staring for thoughts on the next topic. \"),\n",

I think this assignment is cool. all our writing assignments should be like this. the experiment I participated in last week was really boring. I thought it would involve something interesting like tasting some product or doing something physical like a handstand and see how gravity affects blowflow to certain body parts. THAT would be a cool experiment. it could help those poor astronauts and their whatever space effects. HUH!! they should be helping poor homeless people off the streets. its got to be somehting psychological about that because I mean. people could work if there\\'s nothing physical impeding them.

I love the one I\\'m in, because the girls are all so genuine and sweet, but it really takes up a lot of my time. We have 2 meetings every week and then other activities. I don\\'t feel like it\\'s possible to do all of that, study, and make time for a social life. I have been having a lot of fun, though. My mom thinks I party too much. She doesn\\'t really understand that I do work on school stuff, and I do know that classes are the real reason I am here in the first place. I know that I can\\'t go out every night. I don\\'t think I\\'ll have too much of a problem, because I can balance everything and plan ahead if I know something big is going on over the weekend. My seminar class is kind of annoying. It\\'s a stress-management course, and I picked it because it seemed like an easy one, and I really wanted a seminar. Everything\\'s pretty much common sense. We have all these handouts and activities on managing time, organizing, and stuff like that. I do stress sometimes, and I always have a lot on my mind, but I don\\'t let it bother me. I\\'m very organized, and I always find  a way to do everything that I need to and still make plenty of time for myself and fun stuff. My room mate does stress a lot though. She\\'s always a little edgy and panicky. She kind of thinks about everything all at once and worries about it instead of getting something done and out of the way. She kind of looks at the negative side of things sometimes too. She\\'s one of those \"the glass is half empty\" kind of people. It bothers me sometimes, because I like to be positive. I\\'d rather be getting things out of the way, then focusing on everything at once. I also don\\'t think there\\'s a point in worrying about something unless you have to. I\\'d rather just wait and see what happens. I really hope the guy comes to hook up the Ethernet in my room soon. I\\'ve had so many problems with my computer, and I hate having to come to the lab. It\\'s just down the hall, but it would be nice to stay at my desk. It\\'d be more comfortable too, and convenient. My dad bought my computer when I moved in, but it had the wrong kind of Ethernet card installed. Now it has the right one- as long as James comes to hook me up!  I hope there are no other problems, because then I won\\'t know what to do. I\\'m so illiterate when it comes to computers, and I hate that because I don\\'t understand how to fix things--or even how to tell what\\'s wrong. I think it\\'s pretty cool how we can just type all of this on the computer and not even have to turn in a paper. I was kind of surprised. I wonder if everything will be like that in the future; if all work will end up being done over the Internet and just mailed to teachers. It\\'s definitely less of a hassle. I\\'m excited about this weekend. I\\'ll get to see a lot of my family and some friends back in Houston. I really want to see Corey. He\\'s such a great guy, and I think I  really hold back from getting too close to him. I guess it\\'s because I knew I\\'d be moving, and I don\\'t want to be attached to someone that I can\\'t always see. It\\'ll be nice to see him though. I might get to see one of my best friends too. She goes to SFA, but she\\'ll be home this weekend too. I think she\\'s having tons of fun at college too. I\\'m definitely glad I came here. Sure it\\'s big, but it would bother me if it wasn\\'t. I\\'m having fun, and there\\'s always something going on. I love that about big  cities. I can\\'t imagine living in a small town and not having anywhere to go. I would get so bored. I guess it would be different if you grew up  there, though.     '),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"I can hear my roommate clicking on her mouse as she searches for something over the Internet. She's doing her homework, which, to me, seems overwhelming. It's not like high school where even the hardest classes were easy. They were all just blow off courses to me. I never had to really work because the teachers never really graded. College is different though. It's real. High school never counted for anything, but college can determine your whole life. That is what worries me. I feel that one little screw up can ruin my entire life. I have so many worries, so many fears of the future, of making a wrong turn. Man. I look at it now and run into a corner, trying to hide from it. I remember I use to think high school was important, but it never was. I always felt I wasted my high school years. I should have spent more of it doing things I shouldn't have been doing, not doing things I should have been doing. I could have had more fun, I guess. I did have a lot of friends, though. But, I recently met an acquaintance from high school; he didn't think I had any friends. How sad, I thought. He thought I was a loner and made me name all my friends. I didn't even get through half of them, and he said to stop. It's strange. This is the guy whose motto is don't judge. He judged. Everyone judges, even those who promise they won't. I guess in a way he's a hypocrite, but everyone is a hypocrite. That's what's wrong with this world. Society always makes rules, they tell others don't do something, but yet, they still end up doing it themselves. My friend told me that if evil didn't exist then there could be no good. There would be no standards for good. That's very true, I thought. Everyone would always be on the same ground, and no one could be called a genuinely good person. That wouldn't exist and the happiness from finding one who is actually genuinely good wouldn't exist either. Then there's one less thing to be happy about in this world. We need all we can get. There are to many starving people in this world, too many sick, dying, thirsty. There are always abundances where they aren't wanted and not enough where it is wanted. Like recently, Australia was overcome with huge floods. I remember having to take off my shoes and roll up my pants to walk through a river that wasn't supposed to be there. Dead fish floated in it because the water was so cold. There was too much water there, not enough here. But this memory was happy, nonetheless. It was a strange thing that I would normally not have to do. I stood on the tip of my toes with my gear slung over my back and shoulders and walked carefully as to not step on the mounds of dead fish sitting on the river bend. The fish were sad. They died of cold, but in a way it was fascinating to see them. They were being eaten away by bacteria, and their eyes were huge and black, and empty. Their fins were torn up and gills were opened from the bacteria chewing at them. It was horrible, but at the same time fascinating and wonderful. How strange. I'm so against killing animals, but at the same time, something like this is a magnificent sight. I guess that makes me a hypocrite too. No one can avoid being a hypocrite no matter how hard they try. I say I try not to act on my judgments, but I always do, if not then there could be no opinions, and everyone would be naive. In a way though, I have it better than others, I think. I don't see people when I think of them; instead I see the colors I associate with them. How strange, I always think, but that's how I really do see them. I can never see a person unless I actually try to look at their face and when I do, it's strange. It's not familiar. I looked at my sister's face, and even though I've known her my entire life, I was surprised that is the way she actually looks. How strange. My friends think I'm strange for that reason I think. I can't see a person, I can only see their colors, and when I look at a person, they don't seem like the person I know. Because of this, I never look at people anymore. I forget how they look, but I always remember the feeling they give me when I'm around them and the emotions they stir up. I think this is the best way to think. I'm glad I can't see like I'm supposed to. I always have a layer before real sight, and it's wonderful. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='From what I gather, I\\'m supposed to sit here and track what I think as I think it. At this moment, all I can seem to think about is how I missed BA101 earlier today. I went to Calculus, which ended at 2:00 pm, and I was supposed to go to BA101 at 5:00pm. In between this three hour period, I went to sit with a friend while he ate lunch, followed by going up to his room to get a copy of a virus scanner and a game. In doing so, I completely forgot that I even had another class. I ended up watching and playing a video game. I came back, feeling just fine, when my roommate asked, \"Did you go to class?\" I actually had to stop and think, \"Did I have a class to go to?\" Of course, as I\\'ve said, the answer was \"yes. \" Now, I can\\'t escape this panicked, empty feeling in my chest. If there\\'s one thing I generally take pride in, it\\'s my academic \"excellence. \" Part of our grade in the class is based (Of course, I had to miss one of my whopping two classes that actually take attendance!) on participation in discussions, etc. One can easily infer that you might actually need to be there in order to take any part. I already participated one event for the five we can have for extra credit, but I don\\'t know if that will cover the points I\\'m sure to have lost for not going to class today. Incidentally, the way we are awarded points in that particular class seems asinine. Some of the time, we\\'re in small discussion groups, and other times we\\'re in a large auditorium for lectures. Anyway, while we\\'re in our discussion groups, we\\'re awarded \"x\" amount of points per period based on whether or not the TA feels, at that moment in time, that you\\'ve contributed something useful to the group. This is silly because sometimes people just plain don\\'t have either an opinion or much of any knowledge on the topics they may present. Also, if there is something that can be said, it may be declared by someone else before the opportunity to speak presents itself. The grading for our larger project seems to lack sense as well, but we haven\\'t actually started it, so I don\\'t know all that it entails. Now that I\\'ve gotten that out, I feel a little bit more relaxes about my predicament because I seem to recall that the amount of points one can receive per class is minute in comparison to the project that is yet to begin. Plus, there is that extra credit. I\\'ll have to be sure to get all the extra credit I can. From what I\\'ve been told by those who\\'ve actually taken the class, it\\'s supposed to be an easy \"A. \" Even still, I\\'m not starting off on the right foot. This was only our third class day. It\\'s a onehour course that meets, for me at least, only on Thursdays. That\\'s a good thing and a bad thing. It\\'s good because there\\'s plenty of time in between class days to get all the goals accomplished (if you make it to class and actually know what those goals are. ). It\\'s bad because now I have a whole week to think about today\\'s \"event. \" I must stop now. I set an alarm, and my twenty minutes are up. '),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"     My thoughts and feelings-- most of what graces my thoughts and feelings these days are boys. Yes, i'm still in high school, I might add. I have been screwed by boys. All of them in fact. Please just let me tell you about the not calling about the not buying me flowers and the not recognising me for the princess that I am. I guess you could call me high maintenance. And yes you would be correct in assuming so. But I definately deserve to be treated like a princess. End of story. Nothing else to it-- treat me like I'm a princess and I'm as good as yours. . well not really but it goes something like that. My mom taught me how to be a princess, yes, I was taught by the queen herself, Queen Mom. My Queen Mom is sick right now. with pneumonia (don't ask me how to spell it because I don't know and I guess I don't care because you don't see me looking for a dictionary, now do you?)  But anywho, she's really sick and also just happens to be moving to Arizona in two days-- go figure. So she's sick as a dog and I get to pack for her, bring her water, bring her wet washcloths, bring her advil, bring her anything her little heart desires-- as for me?  I'm not the princess when I'm at home-- maybe Cinderella, but as for now, my sick mom is occupying all my time, well at least a little of it, but who doesn't like to be taken care of?  Thus the practice of princessism!  Where's the 'king' you might ask-- well he's in Arizona, (which of course would be the new kingdom. ) making the money so that my mom and I can spend it all on things that we want and really don't need-- he's a really sweet guy. They all say that you 'marry your father' and I would love to get a guy that's as sweet as he is, but I just really don't think that one exists. So this little princess metaphor is really working for me!  I just cannot wait to get married. I think about that a lot too!  Well, not actually being married, but GETTING married-- my wedding!  Every time I go to a wedding or see a wedding dress or blah blah blah. it just gets me all excited!  I can't wait to dress up all pretty and have everyone look at me and say how beautiful I am. ahhh, it's great to think about!  Well I guess that those are probably the only two things that I ever think about-- well except for classes sometimes, oh and being grossly skinny, that would be fun for about a day. I would hate to be skinny forever, that would be terrible, but you want to hear terrible?  Every guy that I've ever dated has been skinnier than me. Now I'm not fat, I'm just not skinny and the guys that I date ARE!  Also, every guy I've dated has also cheated on me, isn't that great for my self esteem?  I really think so, because now every guy I see I'm thinking 'hyyyyaaaaah!  I want to beat the snot out of you!!  I want to karate chop your face until your eyes bleed!! ahhh!!'  . And that's every guy I see, so I'm thinking that a whole bunch too. I guess I think of 3 different things now. Because before it was only two, but then I remembered how much I hated guys and I got to thinking 'well I guess I think about that a lot too'  Maybe I'm not so boring after all. . Just kidding, I really feel like I sound terribly superficial-- I think about other things, but my brain has been so full of bullshit lately that there's not room for much else that won't just be covered in the bullshit of my mind as well. case in point. I guess that's my excuse for not thinking, even though it's really hard for me not to be thinking about something all the time-- that's what's wrong with culture today-- we're always so busy doing something and once there's nothing to do, we're 'bored'  but why is that?  How can we be bored when we always complain about being too busy. wouldn't you think that we'd welcome this so- called 'boredom'??  I think we should. I was bored about 17 minutes ago so I decided to do my writing assignment, and here I am!!  I guess it feels good to vent things, but I probably wouldn't do it unless it was an assignment-- it's good to see my mind on paper even though it's not really paper, it's a screen, but same difference, work with me here, stop being so complicated. Please let me tell you how much I love to sing. . and at the same time I'll tell you that I'm no good because I am, but still, how cool would it be to be the lead singer of a band?  My current official 'non- boyfriend' right now (I broke up with him 4 days ago) is in a band and they're looking for a singer, but I know that he would never want me to sing because he's heard me sing, and well I guess I won't sing in THAT band, but oh well, well that's all I have to say about that. \"),\n",

       " Document(page_content='     Ok, I\\'m thinking about a whole lot of nothing, and unfortunately since I\\'ve been told I type rather fast the professor to teacher\\'s aid will now have to suffer through the horrible task of reading through the unintelligable thought processes of Mark\\'s mind. I hope that no one reads this seriously at all. Ok now someone is watching me type, oh they\\'re gone. That was fast, I\\'m telling you this is a waste of time and I\\'m not going to reveal anything special during twenty minutes. I\\'m actually kind of depressed at the fact that twenty minutes of my own un-interrupted thought would yield so little. I miss my wife. Yeah that\\'s right my wife. We aren\\'t legally married but we would like to consider ourselves married and I do. I certainly hope that no one bothers to mock my idea of marriage because I actually do take it very seriously. I love her more than life, more than anything else in this world and if anyone dares to mock that love or try to deny my marriage to her as real they will have to deal with my constant and thorough wrath. Now I\\'ll write about pizza hut. They got this buffet that\\'s only 3. 99, not bad, but the same as cici\\'s so if they\\'re pizza is not far superior than I will be terribly angry at them for advertising such a horrible deal. I know that was kind of in the middle of nowhere and I will admit that something someone else just said nearby me did actually influence that statement. I hope that this world is a peaceful place for my children I will do whatever I can to ensure this. I love my wife so much. I miss her terribly. There seems to be no longer a thought in my mind except how I have many a time disputed the reality of free will. How can one expect to have something called free will then expect to be judged finally. Because if I had full free will I could have chosen not to be exposed to the information that I would be judged for my actions on earth. But since I couldn\\'t choose whether or not I could be exposed to such information. I am a Catholic. This is a stated fact that some might take as foolish words of a foolish person. But the truth is that I consider myself a part of this religion yet I do not completely agree with all of the aspects of the religion. For example the idea that all gay people will go to hell is foolish to me. My idea of who goes to heaven and who goes to hell is this:  Good people go to heaven. Bad people go to hell. Simple right?  Except what I qualify as a good person is different from what other people think is good. So what now?  Is my idea of good right or is theirs. But wait, the plot thickens. I have a solution to such a simple and timeless problem. You see I believe that God instilled in every human being the basic concience in that discerns between bad and good. The most amazing thing about this theory of mine is that if someone does something I find to be unacceptable I can be certain that they also think it is unacceptable. I am almost always right in this aspect. Every time I have seen something I think is wrong I can eventually approach the person about their actions and they will almost always agree with me that what they did is wrong. However, they will also go as far as to explain their good intentions. The hardest part of that aspect of the conversation is that it becomes difficult to discern between who is just self-delusioned and who genuinely had good intentions. I am not proud of all that I\\'ve done in my life. The only reason I can adopt a theory of shared thoughts of what is right and what is wrong is because I apply this theory to myself and find it to be true. I once actually cheated on one of my ex-girlfriends. One of the worst days of my life. There is no reason I can use to explain my actions. But I did it to end the relationship. Yeah, I know what you\\'re thinking. Good job huh?  Well she didn\\'t want to leave anyway. At least that was what I thought. I was so damn confused. I cheated on her, a rule I set for myself a long time ago was that I would NEVER cheat on a girlfriend. And I did. I disgraced myself and I hate. Er hated myself for it. I did it to invoke another of my rules for myself. Should an infraction upon the rule about NEVER cheating on my girlfriend I must then break-up with her because she deserves better than that. I don\\'t know if I\\'m wrong. But I could be. Man you know sometimes music can just totally change one\\'s mood. Now I\\'m listening to Damien Rice. The little known writer of some of the best music I\\'ve ever heard. I think he\\'s great. It\\'s kind of weird I guess for a guy to like some other guy\\'s music so much but I do. I also like this guy Joseph Arthur a lot because both of these artists seem real to me. Their style of singing their lyrics are all so real. I love the way I can relate to it. I recently read \"A streetcar named desire\". The female role of blanche. She is like my ex. She lies, decieves in the name of giving people what they \"want\"  NEVER tell me what I want. Only I know that and I don\\'t appreciate being told. If anyone ever makes assumptions about who I am before I meet them. I get reasonably angry but I hide it pretty ok. You. For some reason I have been descrimanated against for being Mexican twice in my life. Both times by a girlfriends family. I have an extraordinarily pale complexion. The funny thing about that is one of them is Mexican. Heh what can I say. '),\n",

I wonder why I have to type that out what am I thinking of course this is what I am going to write        this music that I am listening to seems to be distracting me a little and the timer I feel very stressed out writing to a real timer I don't know why        I think I will take off my head phones    I had planned to write about a lot but for some reason I can't seem to do more than   write what my head is thinking about    for one is my head supposed to blank out like it just did I guess I can start by describing my environment lets see    the air smells like air    the back of my back is warm from the sun through the window    right now there isn't any noises and I feel somewhat stressed and anxious    the timer keeps going coldly, without a thought to whether or not I actually have a though or not and I think the seconds are scrolling faster than a real second would. maybe my perception of time is defunct    if it were possible to qualify a sigh in thought-form my mind would have just sighed    I can't believe I have to go pick up my friend later today because his car broke down, its like I have to help him but I fear that he may not help me when the same situation like this occurs to me    I just woke up and for some reason there's a sense of dread weighing down on my heart    as if I feared that I am doing this stream of consciousness writing incorrectly    I can't believe I have already written for 5 minutes, time really does pass quickly when you are trying to listen in on your own inner thoughts    but it seems as if my thoughts are triggered by what I am doing, like I cannot seem to get into any deep right now such as the existence or nonexistence of god which I was arguing quite magnificently the other day but instead here I am babbling like my mind is a stream of babble instead of consciousness and I wonder if I am supposed to be aware that any of this is supposed to make sense I really hope it does because if it doesn't well I guess my mind is simply disorganized    but isn't that what a mind should be? disorganized? don't we need to take time to listen to our minds and organize the stream before we talk? its like the old saying, think before you speak and etc etc etc. if this is how my mind really thinks, I really think I cannot type fast enough to fully express the words in my mind. that is an interesting though, do I actually hear a voice in my head right now dictating everything I've just written? that is really weird, is this how our sense of hearing works? I have my own voice in my head only it doesn't have the auditory quality of my own voice, but rather I can hear it, its a strange process         I guess I really can't multitask when I am writing a stream of consciousness I see three ims on the bottom of this screen, all blinking yet unanswered        perhaps I am not truly tracking my own mind I MUST DWELL FURTHER IN. I'd like to reveal something about myself perhaps something I didn't know existed        I remember my childhood I don't know why but for some reason I start remembering it whenever I think too hard that or I am just trying to find something to say for this stream of consciousness either way . the phone is ringing, should I go pick it up? maybe I will just let my parents handle it, but it keeps ringing and ringing and ringing. looks like I had to pick it up for a bit, I hope the professor doesn't penalize me for 20 seconds of non thought but I can make up for it because it was my friend who I needed to help out today, he sounded pretty appreciative though I dismissed him quickly because of this assignment and here I am fixing mistakes in my typing        maybe I should just leave my mistakes in so I can listen to myself more. right well now I feel nostalgic or actually no I don't I just see a blue sky in my thoughts and clear. no with white clouds and its a clear day and I was a little boy there's a feeling that is not quite nostalgia but it permeates through me likes a majestic feeling as if I were over a cliff and viewing the world for the first time, its breathtaking. another thought sigh. I miss my childhood and here I am back behind my computer again full of stress and anxiety. I would view myself as a logical person not to get emotionalized (if that is a word) which it is not a word but I guess its the only way my thoughts can process it without me actually thinking about  it, yeah I make up a lot of words in my thoughts actually its quite strange why does it seem so hard to write about my stream but when actually I have written so much    originally I had planned to write a debate that was in my head about god but I guess that was yesterday night when I was heated up about it today I just feel complacent about writing about nothing. I see nothing revealing in the past couple of paragraphs, just a jumble of words broken thoughts and now I feel disappointed        why am I disappointed? I guess I just thought I could find something that could prove that I am more than just a regular case or is this stuff that I write even regular to all people? I don't know but I like being special. well no. now I feel embarrassed for writing that out and there's only 3 more minutes to describe the rest of my thoughts for today. its weird how if focused my thoughts do not go much into the future, I can't really plan ahead, I can't think about my future, my ambitions seem to fade away I guess this is the nature of this exercise that causes it since you are supposed to write at present thoughts which tend to mold my thoughts into present thoughts and I don't know why that past thought had blurbed into my mind perhaps I forced it to just for some interest in this stream of consciousness, why am I so eager to put interest in this bit, I do like this interface though what that has nothing to do with what I just said god. now I am frustrated at the fact that my mind is so disorganized that or if I tried to organize it I would have nothing to say it is so hard to just spew everything out the way that I think it because my preliminary thought is to first organize it and that takes so much time and for some reason sometimes I end up saying nothing because I dunno I know I obviously have a stream now but I guess since none of it makes much sense I can't really phrase it into communicable words or rather perhaps I am just afraid that if I do people will laugh at me for being an idiot. 8 more seconds. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1. bye     \"),\n",

I like that schedual because my time is not fully committed to one area of interest. I used to work out every day of the week. I also can't do that anymore because my interests in the martial arts prohibit me from emulating Markus Ruhl. The German Giant! That guy is swool. I think that's how you speel swool. As in it's swoolen. Hum, maybe it's swolen. Whatever, who cares? An English teacher ya but on stream of consiousness? Besides, what if my consiousness doesn't want me to spell it right. Maybe my mind is secretly liberal and is telling me to go against the 'establishment'. 'Damn the Man' and 'down with big brother'  and all of that. Maybe it's my secret way of avoiding conformity. That all sounds like bullshit to me but who can say otherwise besides me. I guess everyone now that I've said it's b. s. but that's not the point. The point is, of this tiny fragment of thought anyway, is that I could basically come up withany excuse I wanted to explain my actions and no one could say otherwise. Why can't you go up on the 'stand' and declare yourself that you were insane at the time of the murder. I mean, expertise and all that junk doesn't insure that from one, or maybe even no meeting at all, meeting a psychologist can determine that the accused was insane at the time of the crime. Does it really even make it more likely? Lets say that my mom was killed. I'd be pretty pissed and I'd break things and fight and all that fun stuff but would I classify myself as insane at the time? No, to myself anyway. If it could get me out of trouble ya, but I would know that I was really just pissed off and sad and all like that. But whatever, how can I talk about this? I have no credentials. Which brings up another point, why do you need credentials? Why do people always quote other people in research papers. I'm mostly talking about philosophy papers and diplomatic position papers. Why quote Plato, was he so enormously intellegent that all your oqn thoughts are irrelevent? Why not write a paper about what you think? Maybe you have read some of Plato's writing, then perhaps you should discuss your thoughts on that but why form an opinion entirely off what other people have said? What does that make you?  A follower, a person who does nothing but agrees. Whats that all about? How could anyone live just agreeing. It really does annoy me though, how people, some people, just quote other people. It's like you can't be wrong if you go with what some dead guy said. I say go with what you say. What's wrong with that. I'm going to make it a point to quote myself int he next paper I write fro psychology. I know that writing a position paper on an issue is your opinion but is it really YOUR opinion if you've already read what someone else has to say. I'd like to do nothing but read purely data filled reports and form my own opinions on what is going on. I also refuse to validate my position by incorporating a quote from a famous dead guy, or an alive one. What I say has importance because I am intelligent. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"well, here I am. writing this essay. ok sorry that was a bit corny. you know. well I just got done taking my first college test in chemistry. it wasn't too bad I guess. but the fact that I stayed you till 2:30 in the morning didn't help much. last night I went to a place called posse. it's a bar that a lot of the people in the band go to. I had a blast! of course I drove and so I had to drive back which wouldn't have been so bad except that it was raining last night. I have a C parking permit. yeah. it's the one that makes you park across the interstate. can you see me running across the interstate soaking wet? it wasn't too much fun. but I got here and got my materials, and started studying in my soaking wet clothes (I had to stay clothed cause I was in my hallway. my roommate was asleep and I didn't want to wake him up. ) I studied a bit, and then got kinda bored with it so I went and got my guitar and played it out in my hallway. I'm pretty sure I broke some rule about quiet hours, but it didn't seem to bother anyone. I was quiet and the songs were soft and pretty. I like to play guitar before I go to bed. it helps me wind down. actually I like to play the guitar anyways. it's such a chick magnet. I have gotten a lot of play just cause I can play the guitar. it's nice. and it's therapeutic. playing guitar that is. I would expect getting booty is pretty therapeutic in some way, but that's not what I'm talking about. it helps me with my problems. I'm not too sure how. well, I guess it just helps me express my emotions and get them out of my system. I like it anyways. I love music. not only listening to it, but performing it as well. I'm in the longhorn band! now that kicks total ass! I mean it's huge, it's a lot of fun, and we get into all the games for free! and actually, this is the best part, WE GET PAID TO GO TO THE OU GAME! YES, THAT'S RIGHT, THEY GIVE US MONEY TO GO TO THE OU GAME! I love thinking about that. all those poor kids with their bracelets. oh well. such is life. I love football too! and what better place to go than here! our football team kicks ass!@! ok. so I don't know where to go from here. hmm. I guess I could talk about how weird it is that when we're asked to think about anything the first thing we do is well, not really think. ya know? is that due to nervousness? is it just some bad habit that teenagers and adults of late have acquired? who knows. I was talking to a friend in your class and she said that she was going to have a hard time wetting this. I think this is pretty easy. I'm fairly scatterbrained so it's cool. I've been noticing this more and more lately. I know I don't have add or anything, but I find myself being absent minded every once in a while. I wonder if add is a real thing. I mean I never really disputed it, but I have friends that think that add is a problem of will power. but who knows. alright. 4 minutes left. what shall I write about for 4 minutes. I'm sure there are some other ramblings I could think of. I play the sax. yeah. I like it. my biology class sucks, both of them really. my 212 is better than my 211 but who cares. I guess I should learn to like them though cause biology is my major. I want to go premed. and become a surgeon. we'll see how that goes I guess. if I don't make it in that, I'll probably switch to music. it would be nice and a music degree from UT has literally a 100% job acceptance rate. that is no lie. and that's a really good deal. we have a great music program here. we also have an awesome social life here. there's always something to do and someone to talk to . ooooooooooohhhh! less than a minute! almost through! what should I write!?!?! I don't know! oh I know! I'll write about   \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"     Today is 911 and it has been a whole year since the tragedy last year. I remember that day being in first period and hearing of a plane flying into the tower. Obviously, that was all the people at school talked about that day, and the shock was great. It surprised me so much that my teachers didn't take out time from classwork to talk about the event. This is the biggest most memorable event of our lives and i thought it deserved more. so much more than just the acknowledgement. Yeah, the principal came on, but it didn't seem like enought. I would have liked to discuss it with my class. Actually, yesterday in my rhetoric class this guy in my class made this annoying comment that he thinks the president took advantage of what happened on 911 to ask the nation for volunteers. I was outraged at what he said, how can you be so stupid (to put it bluntly). . that isn't very nice for me to think but our nation is in a time of need and this past year was a very unique time. The president totally has the right to ask for volunteers and was in no way taking advantage of 911. It bothers me when people speak about that things when they should take more time to think about what they're really saying. . . yeah, so anyways. 911, everytime i hear one of those songs about the event it gives me chills up and down my body, the chills are uncontrolable and it makes me feel good though that it happens. I always get chills when i really really enjoy or care mostly about what i'm seeing or hearing. That is so interesting how the body works that way. I don't think about getting chills but they just start running up and down my body. Although, i get chills i don't usually cry. I'm not a very emotional person, but all depends on what's going on around me. Lately I have been pretty stressed out from the this huge change in living, change in schedule. And, I can cry easier probably because I've been so stressed. I find time to take it away, like when i run, i am not stressed. i could think about all i have to do while i'm running but the thing is i'm not stressed while i'm running because i know i need to run and i can't study while i run so it doesn't stress me out. Does that make any sense in the way i wrote it. In other words, if i was watching tv, and i know i have to study, then i would be stressed because i know i could be studying instead of watching tv. I am very good at managing my time so i know that i will be able to accustom myself and get used to my schedule better. I've just been so used to my routine at home that it is hard to change here. What doesn't help me very much is that i have late classes, no earlier than 11a. m. and the other three days are at 1pm. Therefore, I usually sleep until classes where if i had 9 or 10 am classes i would be up earlier and more time to study during the day. I like to get my homework and what i need to get done out of the way. . . i don't usually find myself as a procrastinator. I've definitely learned my conservative ways from my father and probably picked up most of those traits from him. although i'm not as simplistic as he is. Everything to him is simple. simple. period. it bugs me sometimes how simple everything has to be but i've picked up on some of those things because i see myself doing the same things he does. and it bothers me when people are too loose. I like to clean, organized, in order and when people i know are late and too loose about what they do it irritates me. yes well, i was just thinking about this song i was listening to today called   make yourself   it has great lyrics and you can probably tell from the title what its about: not to let other people influence your ways maybe in the sense of copying them but do what you want to do and feel. make yourself.

I tend to do that. Actually, I constantly go off on these tangents as I hold any conversation. It\\'s quite annoying. But hey, it\\'s me. It\\'s about to rain outside. I was just telling a friend about how hilarious it was that everyone noticed that it was raining when one student left early during class yesterday. And Professor Pennebaker was totally right when he said noone was paying attention anymore to what he was saying because we were all thinking, \"How the hell am I going to get home now?\". I laughed for a long time after that, but I was still thinking about the rain. After I ran out of class I noticed a lot of people were prepared, and had their umbrellas with them. I also noticed that the people with these umbrellas who were walking with someone else without an umbrella, did not share their umbrella with the other person. Not one of them. I thought that was extremely odd. I have never used the word umbrella so many times in one sentence. I\\'m very sleepy now. The rain tends to have that effect on me. I love the rain, not just for that reason but it\\'s also soothing. But I do hate when it rains right before, or when I am about to go out. It\\'s a hassle that I haven\\'t had to deal with for a long time. I\\'m thinking we are in the middle of a drought. I can\\'t wait until winter either. That time of year makes me happy.

       " Document(page_content='Back when I was in junior high school, all students닥oys as well as girls were required to take home economics. In the fall, we sewed duffel bags and pillows shaped like animals. In the spring, we learned how to cook.For our 遼nal cooking class project, we had to cook a dish at home and bring it to class. I knew right away what I was going to make: my Aunt Rosie뗩 famous chocolate cake.My aunt Rosie made the best chocolate cake in the world. It was a recipe she had gotten from her grandmother, who swore her grandmother had personally made that chocolate cake for the Prince of Wales. When I started the cooking class, I had asked Aunt Rosie what made her chocolate cake so special. She told me the secret ingredient was coffee.I had never tried to bake a cake from scratch before, and since the choco- late cake was Aunt Rosie뗩 specialty, I thought for sure she would help me make it.But that would be cheating, she said as a she handed me the recipe. You go home and you make it yourself. Make sure you save a piece for me! she hollered as I headed out the door.At home, I got out my ingredients: eggs, butter, milk, sugar, 遼ne pow- dered chocolate, cinnamon, baking powder, and coffee. The recipe looked easy enough, and I followed each step carefully. When I had mixed every- thing together, I carefully poured the batter into the pan. I put the cake into the oven, which I had preheated as directed, and set a timer for 50 minutes. When the buzzer went off, I stuck a toothpick into the middle of the cake to make sure it was done. It was perfect.When the cake cooled, I opened up a can of Betty Crocker뗩 chocolate123  frosting, spread a thick layer on top of the cake, and covered it with plastic wrap. It was a masterpiece, and I couldn뗪 wait for my classmates to taste it. The next morning, I carried my cake carefully to school. I passed out pieces to my classmates, beaming with pride. But when I saw the look on their faces, I knew something was terribly wrong. I took a bite and nearly burst into tears. No wonder they looked disgusted! Aunt Rosie뗩 cake was never crunchy, and the crunchy things were bitter. The cake tasted awful. My heart sank as I watched Mrs. Wilson take a bite. She crunched, paused,crunched again, paused again, and looked at me thoughtfully.Sarah, she said gently, 띿oes the recipe for this cake call for coffee? Yes, I replied.Hmmm. I thought so.렝hen I questioned her about my mistake, she said, You used coffee grounds. You were supposed to use liquid coffee, she said, and she laughed gently.I was morti遼ed. I vowed to correct my mistake and make a new cake for tomorrow.This time, with a real cup of coffee, I baked a cake that would have made Aunt Rosie proud.'),\n",

Luckily my roommate is in the same class and reminded me, so now I am awake. Since I have been here I have never spent the night completely alone in our room. However, this weekend I have to stay in town for some dumb sorority match and retreat, while one of my roommates goes home to Houston, one to Dallas, and the other is always at her boyfriends. So this weekend I will be sleeping here all alone, which kind of sucks. I used to always stay home alone, for weeks at a time. But it will be weird to stay here alone, since I have been here all of three weeks. Right now I am on the phone with the Health Center people, because I woke up with a swollen eye, which doesn't feel to great, so I am about to go take care of that. It is really annoying, it isn't painful, just a constant pain. Another thought on my mind lately has been one of my friends; he is also my date to the OU game in a couple of weeks. About a week ago he depledged from his fraternity cause it wasn't for him, he isn't the normal frat guy. However, the other morning when he came to pick up my ID he was wearing the outfit that they have to wear for their pledgeship. When he depledged I had a lot of respect for him because he never does things on his own, and while all his friends were pledges he wasn't. When he said he was back in it worried me. I think it is just because he is bored because none of his friends are ever there, so he is all alone. But we will see how that goes. \"),\n",

I am glad that I came to this school because if my parents had made me go to a smaller, local university then I would have always wondered what it would be like to come here. Now that I am here I am sure that I was better off at a smaller school. But I think I will really enjoy what I learn about other people while I am here. At the present moment I am having to learn time management. I have load of work to do in each class and I feel that if I am not doing my work continuously that I will fail.

There\\'s this thing that my friends and I call a train thought and this is when one thought leads to another. The thought about chocolate making me fat leads me to think about my eating habits in college.

I don\\'t know if I am completely used to the whole college idea yet. Oh my goodness, I met my exboyfriend today. What a small world. I thought that I would never see him again. Oh, you probably don\\'t want to hear about that stuff though. I wonder how my best friends are doing back at home. I miss them a lot. I feel like I left everything behind.

I have a severe problem with being nocturnal and then not wanting to to anything druing the day ohter than lay around. I think that i am starting to get a little better but i'm not quite sure if i will ever be able to have a good nights sleep. at night. I also and having an interesting time adjusting into school. i have been in school for a year sttraight and I think that i still have   senioritis.   I just don't have the drive to do anything, but i know that i need to get good grades.  I am enjoying my classes this fall much more than the ones that I had this summer. they are actually things that I am interested in and my proffessors are weird or mean like the ones that I had to deal with in the summer semester here. I absolutely love UT, i don't think that there is any way that I could have stayed at home much longer. I'm to the point now that it is really weird whenever i go home and i don't like it very much. I have even started to call austin home. This really bothers some of my friends, mainly the ones who still like back in keller or around keller. I miss my parents a lot and i fell bad that I dislike being at home. I love my mom so much and i worry about her because i know that she is sad. I love my dad too, he and my mom are my favorite people in the whole world and i don't know what i would ever do without them. I feel that i am a disappointment to them though. I am nothing like my sister and i don't have half the book smarts that she does. She got all the intelligence and i got all the common sense, which isnt good when you are going to a school like UT. I love my sister a lot, i just don't know if she likes me that much. We have always had to deal with a lot of sibling rivalry. and you would have thought that it had gotten better but it is just so hard for us to talk sometimes. i think that she is amazing though and i look up to her so much. Right now, I am rally worried about my friend, his dad died not long ago, and i don't know how he is doing. He drinks and smokes all the time and one of his roomates and i are really worried, but it hasnt reached the point where we can say anything to him yet. I think that he would get extremely deffensive especialy if his roomate said something. I really don't know if i can type for another ten minutes, i thought that this time would fly by, but it is actually going really slow. I also don't kow what it is you are expecting from this exercise because i am sure you get a lot of random responses. Anyways, my favorite thing to do in the whole world is Dance. I have been dancing since i was like three and i need to get back into in. Dancing is my utopia and it always makes me feel better. I love everything about it and i know that i need to start taking again before i completely lose the ability. But, it is just so hard to find the time and the money. I need a job if i am going to pay for it and i feel bad asking my mom and dad to pay for it because they are putting so much money into me going to school right now. Aside from my weird sleeping schedule, I also am really weird when it comes to eating. I don't think that I have an eating disorder, but i think that i have something wrong with my stomach that makes me gag, or go through times when i just don't get hungry and the thought of food makes me sick. I think that a lot of my friends worry about me though and think that i am either anorexic or buliemic. I do admit that i am very small, but not discustingly so. I have been living in my apartment for like two weeks now and i have yet to completely unpack my room, this is another example of me being entirely too worthless and having no drive to get up and do something. I know that i will unpack eventually, but i never really see the point. I do love it in my apartment though, my roomates are so cool, and they are really nice to me. I hope that they like me as much as i like them. i am sure that it is kind of weird for them though, like i am invading their territory because, they all knew each other before this and then i moved into the picture. I am going home this weekend for my   boyfriends   birthday. I miss him a lot and i wish that he would transfer to UT. I don't know what is going to happen if we continue fighting like we have been, plus, he just got into a frat, and i don't really like the idea of that too much. I have less than two minutes left and I have absolutely no clue of what to write. I think that after I am done with this I am going to go eat some lasagne. I have a huge craving for it right now for some reason. I think it is because it is five in the afternoon and all i have eaten is fruitloops. Hopefully no one actually reads these assignments because im sure the incessant ramblings of a college student can get kind of redundant and confusing. i know that i would not want that job.  \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='First I am wondering why I am doing this assignment - this seems silly but still my mind is always wandering and therefore this should not be difficult. I hope Camille calls me back this evening. I really think I should be a happy guy as long as she stops talking about her dog. She is silly with her blonde hair I am hungry Jester food is so amusing I wonder if I can eat that food everyday after I graduate the girl sitting next to me is very \"not amusing\" I hope she does not stand up, for she probably wouldn\\'t appreciate what I say about her I wonder if anyone else stares at people they find unattractive she probably thinks I want to take her on a date or something because I keep looking at her, but in reality the only place I would take her is to the zoo and tell her to stay there I don\\'t enjoy typing but I suppose it keeps my fingers from getting fat when I took keyboarding in tenth grade I learned to type fairly fast but the only thing I remember typing in that class was the sentence Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country. who said that Kennedy Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country how exciting I would like to think that includes women as well because they can die too oh no the ugly girl just caught me looking at her I acted like I had a bug in my eye she is talking with the girl next to her, and surprisingly enough she is typing the same silly assignment I am  I really hope she is in the same lecture class as I am because I would like to sit next to her and ask her why her hair smells so bad is it a lack of shampoo or is it a hereditary flaw  either way I remember whey I watched Back to the Future part III when they were in the 1880\\'s I bet everyone smelled back then  Clint Eastwood has been in alot of western movies I really do not like this computer because the more I write the more the screen moves over as if the line is a mile long  I have written for seven minutes already and I have only written seven lines  one line a minute is about as fast as I eat a taco but taco bell has this new hot sauce that they call FIRE how scary I can drink that stuff it is so hot I threw some on our fire in our chimney at home and it put the fire out  the girl working at the counter in the computer lab is not amusing either  Those glasses she is wearing went out of style when Marsha Brady graduated highschool  if she has binoculars she can probably see my screen from her seat so if she kicks me out before twenty minutes I wonder if Mr. Pennebaker would be sympathetic  why are there pictures of whales on the wall maybe to remind most of the girls in here they ought not to eat too much I had a girlfriend named Paige Scott in seventh grade and we called her whale  but I didn\\'t care because she was so nice  That is good  All guys should only care about personality to an extent, anyway  that\\'s why I like Camille. maybe two or three girls have come through my life that I could honestly say I didn\\'t care what anyone else thought about them because I like them anyway. the last to own that title got pregnant last month so I was kind of angry with her. Most girls would probably break up with their boyfriends when they only offer to pay for 1/3 the cost of an abortion and they spend that money on marijuana  I was happy to lend her the money maybe she\\'ll realize she\\'s better off with me anyway because I would have paid for the entire thing and I would have gone through the procedure I God allowed me too  how long has it been now ok five more minutes   what would you like to know?   SUBMIT YOUR PAPER  that sounds silly I would rather crumple it up and throw it at my teacher   Teachers should tell the class more about themselves so may be I would now rather or not it was acceptable behavior to throw my exams at them. Do they like baseball?  I went to look up my friends number at the university of Texas And m but he was not listed. The computer seemed to think he was the head of the alumni or something. Doubt it - he probably won\\'t graduate because he smells too  he and Bevo ought to share a bathroom. he used to have a shaved head and a little horn on top. Which reminds me of the dumbest thing he\\'s ever done when he worked at a video store and stole 12 porno movies. His parents are head of the Christian Mission Church or something and they were kinda mad. he has no scruples he had to pay 180 dollars for those movies and he wanted to watch them at my house. Doubt it I don\\'t steal from video stores and I will not agree to his stealing them either, but I did watch this movies at his house. they were exciting I guess one of the girls names was heather Hooters she was pretty but I doubt she was 100% natural is anyone I know going to read this?  That\\'s ok cause I am happy with who I am   I will tell the whole world I love, well something, I won\\'t mention because if the president of this university knows he will transfer me to a and m. ok I love farming. The sound of the plow chu chu chu through the grass is almost enough to bring me to orgasm. one more minute can you tell I \\'m looking at my watch I shouldn\\'t treat this as a paper where I am talking to someone else but rather just with myself but how can I think about anything else when my fingers hurt so much from typing maybe Camille will call but I hope I can hold off on calling her - time to eat - Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country.       Oops I almost hit the clear button. '),\n",

His music is blasting so loud right now and I can't even think and he's just talking away and I want to go to sleep and take a nap I think I only got like a couple of hours of sleep last night so I'm tired and I didn't get to eat breakfast My bed makes all these squeaky noises when I sleep and it's really annoying and my pillows keep following off the bed I don't like my green book sack it's not that pretty I think it looks ugly I'd rather have my red Gap book sack People at UT don't seem to care about clothes but maybe Asians care about clothes Hmmm Enok seems really soft but hard, he's like a tough guy but not and I'm ugh what's wrong with that boy. Man it just seems like all he ever does is play on his stupid computer and he's getting mean now. He was really mean when I asked him about the fire drill the other day because he's probably fake like that like Paul Gosh Paul annoys the crap out of me I hope he doesn't come to UT because that would just be horrible. But knowing my luck he's going to come to UT and that would just be great Kenny's a pretty good roommate but I think he might be getting annoyed with me or something because I sleep later than he does and I think I talk more than he does something is wrong with him too because he never talks now I look at him differently for some strange reason and I want to be a bad kid again rather than the 'good' Christian boy I used to be I want a tattoo and I want some piercings hmmm that would be cool and my classes are okay but I have this guilty feeing and I don't know why I don't know if my friends here are true or not, maybe it's better if I just keep to myself more because I have this bad feeling that I haven't really met someone that's truly there you know I mean Debra is nice and all but still I think she might be fake and Sing just uses me he looks like a damn alien it's so gross ahhh I have to wash my face in a few seconds after I'm done with this because I think I'm getting acne again and that would just be horrible I though asians weren't supposed to get acne.

       " Document(page_content=\"okay well I have 20 minutes to write this paper well isn't that exciting. I believe I\\x92m the worst speller and typer in the world. it seems like this is a really long page anyway I just wrote to my friend marissa who goes to southwest and I was going to write my friend Jamie who I meet this summer at work but I was stupid and didn't get her email address of the letter she sent me and erased so now I can't write her, she probably thinks I\\x92m the biggest bitch right now . I wonder if you all actually read these and analyze them . I want to go into criminal psychology because I think it sounds very interesting and believe it would be good for me when I try and get into the FBI I hope I can get into it. what if they turn me down. then I\\x92ll have worked all these years for it and gotten nothing from it . I think I will get in though . You know what I hate is when your hands get on the wrong keys on the key board and if your not watching you can write three sentence all messed up because of one little misplacement of the hand . I really hope you all don't read these because mine is kind of silly. anyway I slept for a long time today and I still feel tired I think if you sleep to much it makes you more tired, that's just my theory. It seems like I've been at this computer for ever because the note I wrote to my friend Marissa was really long and I\\x92m not that fast of a writer. When you stare at I computer screen real long it seems like your in a trance just like when you watch t. v. you just totally can veg out. a girl just poked her head in the door. I\\x92m down in the computer lab right now because I don't have a computer and the one my room mate has doesn't have the Ethernet set and she's hooked up to America on-line so I can't use my password to log on so I have to come down here. I really want a t. v. in my room. I know it is such a trivial thing but sometimes it's just nice to come home and relax and watch some t. v. Noelle said she was going to get one before we came down but now she doesn't want to spend the money on it and my parents and I don't have the money so we are just stuck with out a t. v. It's okay though I'm sure it's better for me. the only thing is I don't know when anything is going on . I need to find out about the ani dafranco concert for Jacob I just don't know who to ask or where to look. anyway about the t. v. I don't get a newspaper and the daily Texan doesn't tell you every thing that's going on around the world. so a t. v. would be helpful so I could watch the news. well my mind just went blank and I have nothing to talk about. I love to people watch ,  it's cool to see the way different people act. That's why I think psychology would be interesting. I like to know how people tick. I hope me and Shawnee stay best friends through out the year because I really want her to move down here next year, but when I went home last weekend I don't know if she had fun with me or not. oh well I won't worry about because what ever happens will happen. I\\x92m sure it will all work out for the best what ever it is. my 20 minutes is up now so I\\x92m going back to my room . so long. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='I thought I would because I\\'ve visited with my friends so many times before, but now that I\\'m actually here it\\'s finally true. I\\'m away from my parents, it\\'s so great. I live with three great girls in my suite and we\\'re so popular here. I\\'ve always been a socially outgoing person, but now I feel like it\\'s going to work. there are always large numbers of people in our living room, bringing in food or beer to contribute to our refrigerator; everyone munches from it. and it\\'s OK. the RA told us about this girl in another room who got so upset because her roommate ate her store bought cookies without asking; she called her mom and was so upset. I\\'m so glad its not like that here. we all contribute and all consume. But it\\'s not like there\\'s always noise and party\\'s here. only when we all decide. if one person wants to read or study or sleep, we\\'re really considerate. I hope that lasts, I\\'m pretty sure it will. At our building there are many foreign exchange students which is always a plus because, come on, who minds a foreign accent every once in a while. this guy from Belgium and this one from England are always watching TV in our room, which is another amusing thing: we don\\'t have cable, or an antenna, or a VCR, so we only get FOX Channel 7. We sit around and watch whatever\\'s on. in one way it\\'s good because we don\\'t have arguments over which channel to watch. maybe simplicity is  the root of compromise. We had a floor meeting the other night here and they discussed some issues that had come up. it was so funny because almost all of them referred to our room\\'s shananagans. This one guy came here from where he lives in a house to use the laundry (he\\'s one of our friends- our referring to my roommate and I we\\'ve been friends since 2nd grad, long time, huh? ) anyway, he dropped like half a box of laundry detergent on the stairwell and no one noticed for a week. the RA got mad and cleaned it up herself, but it was amusing because he doesn\\'t even live here. another thing was the \"stolen furniture\" incident. we are given this loveseat-type couch in our suite\\'s living room that can maybe seat 3 people if you\\'re lucky. and in the lobby of the 3rd floor in front of the elevator there are 2 large couches that just block the pathway, no one ever sits in them, and they could probably seat 5 or 6. so when no one was around, my suitemate and I and 3 other people that happened to b in our room at the time helped us move our dinky little couch into the lobby which is down the hall and around a corner. we hauled the large couch down the way and we had to tilt it sideways and temporarily knock off some of the ceiling tiles just to make it in the doorway without banging down the door across from us. now we have a nice couch that is well used and the RA\\'s are threatening to do a room check to find it. why?  its going to more use. It\\'s all kind of a double standard anyway. The head RA is always in our room hanging out and drinking our beer. he has a crush on me so he always brings us stuff and won\\'t mention the couch to the others and lets us into the cafeteria at night. it\\'s pretty funny, one night the night guard knocked on our door because someone had made a noise complaint. we opened the door and the guard stood in the threshold and the head RA stood behind the door quietly while we got reprimanded. it probably wouldn\\'t have been in his best interests to b seen in there. He\\'s only 20, but the building is changing management, so right now he\\'s the head guy. its odd. I\\'m 18. finally. I could be in a management position at the pool I lifeguard at in the summers, next summer. it seems odd that I\\'m really an adult. when you\\'re a kid u never think that you\\'re ever going to get to the point where you decide when to come home and when to do this and what to do in this situation, type thing. its like the transition from high school to college really is that much of a change in that you\\'re independent. it feels so good to finally b independent, financially, physically, emotionally. its wonderful responsibility. I am responsible for watching my budget, if I don\\'t, no one will bail me out (well that\\'s probably not true but you know). I guess I\\'m trying out freedom on borrowed wings, I can always have that security blanket if I want, but I don\\'t want. I want to be independent. I am right now, I hope to stay that way '),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"I am hungry. I haven't eaten since last night. I have a chemistry test on Thursday and I do not understand some of the stuff. I hope nobody comes to my home on Wednesday night. Usually people are always at my home and I don't get any studies done. They stay until 2 or 3 at night and then it is too late to study. Why don't I study in my room? Probably because I don't want to study when people are outside partying. Why don't you go to the library? I don't want to go to the library. After 5, I don't want to have anything to do with school. I don't want to think it even exists. Library reminds of school. On Wednesday, I get off at 5. Good I have until 9 to study until people come over. 4 hours is more than enough to study for a stupid test that is probably easy as hell. I am just worrying over nothing. I actually like it when people come over; it is not boring then. Just do your studies early and then party later. I had heard there were fine women in this university but I was fooled. I haven't seen any girl that is eye popping fine. All the girls on campus have the same old stuff. Legs and other stuff that I do not want to mention here. I am sick of the same old stuff, why can't there be a girl that has a pretty face with all that other stuff. Like a perfect package. Well whatever it is damn hot outside. I have to go to my classes in this heat and then study my brains out. Then go to work and then return home again in this damn heat and still not see a fine girl. Then take the bus home and then study again. Then I hang out with my friends. Which makes doing all this worth it. And I would just like to comment that the damn west campus bus takes at least a half an hour to get to the bus station and sometimes it is full and you have to wait another half hour for another bus. They need to freaking spend a little money to buy more busses, cheap skates. I have do go through all this crap and then I can't even get a decent ride home. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"     I guess  I will talk about the guy I was dating before I came here, since I just got off the phone with him before I got on the computer to complete this assignment. After dating him for two months I realized relationships differ greatly from person to person. There are no straight rules to follow. Everyone makes up there own rules when they date someone by what is right for them. At first I was so confused by this guy  because he did not call me on a regular bases or he didn't schedule dates like other guys did. After just talking to him now has made me realized he didn't do this to be a jerk but it is who he is, because he only called me when he had something to say to me. Right now he is dating another girl but he doesn't call her and she doesn't call him. I think that is weird. I guess I will have to learn that relationships will give me experience to meet all sorts of people and how to deal with them. I still talk to this guy everyday and we are friends but I am getting to know him better than when we dated because now we are forced to rely solely on talking and no physical contact. I had lunch with this guy earlier who trying to make the long distace relationship thing work. I was thinking I could never do that. I think it would be hard to trust someone that much or not have physical contact. Because I believe that seeing someone and spending time with them is a big part of a relationship, so that is why the guy and I are not together. I thinkI'm still new to the dating thing because I don't understand it. I try not to play games, but sometimes its hard not to if the other person is. I have mostly dated older people. My first real boyfriend was seven years older than I. That relationship was not a good idea he was at a different point in his life than I was. His majurity level was that of an eighteen year old boy, that was why it lasted as long as it did. I think sometimes people stick together because they fear that there won't be somebody else in the future to fill that person's spot. After breaking up with him I felt I needed a boyfriend and I even felt a little lonely. Now I am fine and mostly dated for fun I guess you could say but my parents thought it was stupid. I gained a lot of experience this summer and have learned what characteristics of others I find attractive or of high standing and what I don't want my future husband to have one day. Not to say I am definitly marrying someone but I hope I will find that right someone. For right now though I am going to stick to being a loner because being so close to someone can be distracting and my purpose here is to stay focused on school becuase before I ever get married I want to have finished school for my own personal goal. You can't always rely on others in life so if I get a good education I can get a good job to support myself. This has made me realize that when you do something do it for yourself and not for anyone else and don't stop what you are doing just for someone else. Because that someone else might not always be there. This has led me to conclude that you shouldn't care what others think because if it makes you happy than go for it as long as it doesn't harm anyone else. I hope I fulfilled the assignment by writing aobut what I was thinking about. I feel confused by relationships and I guess I should be and I am assuming that everyone else is confused by them as well. I just hope everything will work in the long run and so I'll try not to worry about because I used to worry about things to much that I would stress my self out. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"     Right now I feel kind of tired from schoolwork and extracurricular activities. Last night I felt cranky and could not concentrate much. I think it had something to do with having two tests on a given thursday. My nose is sort of stuffy and my eyes seem to be watery. I noticed today that the sky was a little cloudy as I walked to all of my classes. I thought that meant that there was high humidity or something. Possibly too much water in the air meant that there was more sweating and less evaporation of the sweat. I just came back from the student service building to get two vaccinations. One for meningitis and the other for Hepetitus B. I felt worried about diseases when I arrived on campus. In addition to the worries, I obtained a pamplet from the student services building recommending that I get the shots. My left arm feels a little different than usual. The nurse warned me of possible side effects but I was not too worried about that because I do not have any known allergic reactions. I think I try to type faster than I am able to and because of it I seem to make many mistakes in my typing requiring me to use the backspace key often. I think that when I was learning how to type I emphasized speed more importantly than preciseness or acuratcy. My neck and shoulders feel a little tight and cramp. My lower back pain has been giving me some trouble. I remember seeing the chiropractor about a month ago and he told me a little exercise would do just fine. I felt relieved knowing that my x-ray results were good. I came out to be that I had an extra lower back vertabrae. Not too rare but not particurally normal. My eyes are now feeling dry and probably red by now. Ever since I started wearing contacts , for about 3 years now, I've been worried about the dryness, redness, and clarity of my eyes. I might need to use some eye drops now. I think it might have something to do with my shots but the nurse did warn me about possible side effects. I usually don't think stuff like that will effect me directly. Although some things that i don't think effect me usually do. For instance when I got into my car crash about three months ago  I didn;t think that it would happen to me. My parents would tell be to be careful in the rain but I would usually ignore that fact that I'll end up in an accident. I wouldn't rool me eyesor anything disrepectful, but I would just let the message slide. I would later realized that the message was important just made iinto a routine thing to say from my parents. I should really try harder to listen to people than to jsut make them fell good at the moment. I sometiems feel that people don't listen to thers anymore. they just try to make rapport with each other including nonverbal communications. Girls might do this more than guys. but i think i do it enough to make me feel comfortable. I would really like one day without realizing my lower back problems. It's not that bad but it;s annoying for me to worry about as much as i do. I crack my nect and back like every thirty minutes. I'ts becoming routine just like people reminding you to drive safely like at night. This is different though. I't what I say to myself. I wonder if that will ever be ignore. Probably not since it's not someone else controlling me but myself. Control is difficult to explain. I'm wondering when this will end. another minute or so. After a whild of this I started ignoring the computer screen and just started to stare adn my keyboard checking to see it my fingering is good or not. I don't think i;m a fast typer or a good typer. Just an average typer that makes too moany typing mistakes. Less by looking at my fingers.  \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"     Currently my mind is drifting from one focus to another. Today is my 9 month Anniversary with my girlfriend and best friend in my life. She is the best thing that ever happened to my life. I want to by her a ring and I have been giving it plenty of thought. I have been experiencing a guilt trip as of last night. I thought about my grandmother, who is affected my Alzheimer's. I felt gult come over me when I thought of all the times I yelled at her. I live my grandmother but thats not the damn of it. I generally understand that I am not truely mad at my grandmother when I yell at her. I am mad at the disease. I don't want to loose her or any other member of my family. I got addmitted to the Business school thats the reason I am here. And I have been thinking that I have not earned the opportunity of a lifetime that I am living. I worked harder than most and I played 4 sports and still graduated 16 of 400 in my Senior class. But again I feel guilt when a prodigous amount of people introduce themselves and they mention their major. What should be a privelege to me is actually the most dreaded words I could say,   I'm in the Business School.   People look at me in dismay and in a downward direction which I can officailly say bothers me. I love my mom. . She called me today and gave me a few more pointers that should have stayed under 2 minutes in our conversation. She is so worried about me. Oh and this paper im writing is helping me to think of all the things that are roaming in this spaceous mind I have. My roomie says that I complain alot. . do I. My girlfriend has said the same but I disagree with them both. I just want to be the best at everything and I have to win or im not happy. Just knowing that my effort was not enough haunts me for days. God made me competitive and thats the way I live. Back to that Business thing. . I worked my butt of to get into that school and this college. See my parents had a divorce my junior year of High School. Thus, my lack of attending school cause my grades to faulter as well as my happiness. My dad left us and I can still see tears in my mom's eyes as we carried opposite ends of the furniture and tears trinkled down her face. Besides that I'm in love and I have the best girl I could ever dream of. Her mom says we can't be together but all through our Senior year we stayed together. Sacrafice, that is what makes a best- friend a best friend. Not loyalty and all the Universal answers to what makes a best friend. She sacraficed her family to be with me. Her mom said,   either u have him and loose your family or you can listen to me and forget about him.   She chose me in an instant. . For a long time I woundered why. . And to this day the only answer I could find is love. True love is what we share and today is 9 months. Love is like the wind, you can't see it but you can feel it. My grandfather had to raise me since I never had a father. That hurts me more than the world could ever know. Oh another thought came to me. I am suffering from sexual frustration. I'm not sure if I can say that but you asked for whats on my mind not what you want to hear right?  Well me and my girlfriend have not seen each other for alomost a month and 1/2. Seems like forever but we will be fine. We pray every night for help and hope to some day get married. I nedd to buy a ring. . let me write that down. If i complain too much sorry. Thats just me right?   \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"well, today was ok in te beginning, I met lucy for our first class and we sat together we pretty much spent most of the day together I just didn't realize how easy it was to spend time with someone new. she is just someone who's easy to get a long with  but after walking around campus for a million years we came to jester to check out the learnsing skills center and there was so much stuff there to help us study and do homework for cal and chem. the lady there was so nice and helpful, the trip was really worthwhile. I tried to buy stamps from the vending machine, but it just wouldn't take my money. I had to go back and forth too many times. finally I bought some out of the other machine where I didn't get ot chose which stamps I wanted which kinda pissed me off. then we went to dobie to visit karen and christy. while we were there I had fun. but then my ankle started hurting a lot and I guess I just walked on it too much. we went to eckerds to get my pictures and a lot of them look good. I was kinda mad that the pictures of the flowers and such I took got messed up and I can't retake them. oh well. I was kinda scared walking all the way back to kinsolving because ppl could see my injured ankle and someone could've just come up and assaulted me. at the time, I was kinda hoping someone would cause there's just so much stuff here that's depressing. when I got home, I was about to cry cause I was thinking again about how no one comes over here to visit me. I mean, who are my real friends (that is if I have any) they're so lazy they can't even come over here to visit. no one really calls me either. I just don't know how to describe it cause I know if I REALLY wanted to talk to them I could just call, but well, no one really calls me. it's just frustrating cause while erin's out all these ppl always call and when she's over she's on the phone so much and she goes out every night. i know I don't need to go out and be on the phone all the time, it's just that it's really lonely not hving anyone over here all the time to keep me company. maybe if erin and I were more talkative or she was home more often. i don't know, it's just weird. what am I supposed to do about stanley? I mean, I actually would've gotten into a relationship with  him even though I know it'd just be physical, but sometimes that's what I need. the touch of someone who cares. but I guess stanley doesn't really care. he just was thinking of himself and how he needed to satisfy his urges. it's not fair! it's not fiar at all that I have to be here alone when I see so many ppl on the outside who have b/f and g/f and they don't really look like they deserve them. I don't know where to go f/ here cause I feel so lonely a lot and no one can really understand how I feel. crying right now. i don't even feel as though god understands or can hear how troubled I am. i just wish that there was someone who REALLY cared, someone who'd ALWAYS be here for me. but it's like I can't REALLY count on anyone. everyone has their own life. and it's always about them. i don't like being alone. if I just killed myself, I could end all this, but I don't want to. but I do. i need to find out what the future will be like. even if I never find someone who appreciates me, if I can just somehow find some happiness. just a little. go one day where I don't cry or think about being lonely. just a little something. it's not fair. what do I do? it's hard to go on each day trying to endure the battles that come with  each day. trying to face the hardships. if only I could do what I really wanted to do. scrapbooks and drawing and painting have money to do what I wanted to. build my dream house. design it, oversee the construction. one day. that's my dream. to have a wonderful house to live in. where I can go to find myself at peace. a weight room, sauna, spa, pool, greehouse, huge living room with  a giant entertainment center, huge bedroom and bath, huge windows. a painting art room, dojo, so many things I want to do. but I don't know if that will bring me happiness. how am I supposed to be happy if I can't share the big house with  someone I love. someone who loves me back. loves me as much as I love them. it's hard to think of what love is when I think that I've been there, and not been able to feel the same f/ the other person. what am I doing here anyway?? there's nothing for me now. i'm so alone. alone in this room with  no one calling me, asking me to do anything. what kind of friends do I have? no one is as considerate as me or maybe as sensitive as me. i just don't like being alone. if someone wanted to ask me out, in desperation. like donald said, being in love with  the thought of being in love. maybe that's what I've been in with  anthony. but I really thought he was the one. the one I could spend my life with . will I ever be able to fine someone to end my loneliness? \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Twenty minutes seems like a long time when you are asked to just sit there and type something but when you think about it it really isn\\'t that long. You can do all sorts of things in twenty minutes that are enjoyable such as play guitar (which I don\\'t) or scuba or imagine you are climbing mount everest and even if you don\\'t do any of these things it is fun to pretend to do so. I normally am happy that I type very fast but now I\\'m realizing that since this is timed that will be a disadvantage to my fingers which hurt sometimes after I type for a long time, maybe I\\'m too old for this type of exercise. Its possible. Anyways, only two minutes have passed and this doesn\\'t seem to be going anywhere. While we are on the subject of contractions in the English language, I noticed that I haven\\'t been putting apostrophes in all of my contractions and that would probably make English teachers spin in their graves but it doesn\\'t really bother me because I am a double EE/physics major and don\\'t have to take any English classes ever ever hahaha, oh sorry, got the best of me, anyways where was I? I like orchids, they are the coolest flower. And that reminds me of that chinese art with the brushes where they use really dark ink to make the branches of trees or limbs of bushes and then really bright red or other color to make the petals of the flowers. The thing I like about those is that they don\\'t have any leaves and I really wish I could do that art as they could. And now a whopping five minutes has passed and I am 1/4 done with this assignment and I don\\'t know how I can possible continue writing this fast for that long but I guess I will have to endure, because if the Romans could withstand years of constant battle and such things (I don\\'t want to pick the right word that would be a sign of conscious thought and we don\\'t want that right now for this exercise (I hope I\\'m spelling that right)) where was I, you if the Romans can withstand all that battling and make all their cool things with limited resources then the LEAST I can do is write this for twenty measly minutes which really isn\\'t that long and I\\'m thinking I could leave this here and say I\\'m a slow typist but that would be morally wrong and would be grounds for going to the effigy of fiery hell that is ruled by Satan and I don\\'t know why I\\'m talking about this because I am not religious at all and the reason that is is because (is is is not good to use in a sentence, especially not is is is) sorry, anyways the reason I\\'m not religious is because of my scientific type of mind and even though my parents are religious (although not devoutly or anything) I still have trouble believing in any type of organized religion because if those people that made the religion or believe in it were born in a different country they would believe something different than they do now. and its still only been 8 minutes so this is going to be pretty long I assume. I used to test my typing speed while doing exercises like this because I can think of random things to say aster than I can read them so there is less of a limit to trying to put things into the keyboard (which by the way when you want to get something from the keyboard in C++ you have to type; near the top, and who said these classes didn\\'t tie in together, they were obviously wrong. I\\'m really starting to run out of ideas so I think I will talk about Shakespeare a little while and why his philosophy is related to that of Michael Jackson\\'s song \"bad\", actually that is all complete BS but if I talk in an eloquent enough manner no one will know, save the Shakespeare philosophers who are aficionados of Michael Jackson I really have to go back through this and be sure to fix all my errores gordos (that\\'s what Mr. pickering called them in Spanish class, meaning fat errors, or errors that shouldn\\'t be in a paper because they are so basic that no one should miss them, like capitalization and spelling and such) anyways I have 9 more minutes and I\\'m typing as fast as I was and this fan really is blowing some stinky air through the room and neither I nor my room mate can think of where the stench is coming from and I had put a typo on the last is which read S until I changed it and I bet you are glad you know that now, it put a lot of your worries to rest now that you know that I fixed my typo (hey that rhymed, pretty neat huh) and what\\'s with all these words like neat and phat and off the hook and such, they are fun to say but why do we feel the need to say them, I was reading an article about how it helps teenagers identify themselves as distinct characters in a world of homogenous people and that kind of makes sense hold on I\\'m getting an AOL Instant message, but its from a person who I don\\'t want to talk to at the moment because of some stuff that happened even though its all better know I must have a VERY long runon sentence but it doesn\\'t matter now because this is not English class. back to that Instant message, someone just messaged me again and this time they are talking on some microphone and I\\'m supposed to be able to tell what they are saying but all it sounds like is a bunch of static and a low, distorted \"HALLOW\", hello, you see. and while I\\'m on the topic of jargon and slang I can explain to you some of the hold on some person in my dorm just walked in and he has on a grey shirt and his name is payab, but I\\'m not sure he is a freemason, speaking of which they are the people that lead a cultist movement and there was this person named MASON in our class who went to the air force and me and my friend always called him MASSSSONNNNNNN really loudly and obnoxiously when we saw him in the hall and thank the lord I only have a minute left of this assignment my fingers are tired and this sentence has been going (is sentence or sentence the correct spelling) anyways this has been going on for too long and now I want to quit and I\\'m looking down at the bottom right of my screen to see when the clock will hit 2:20 but is hasn\\'t yet oh well close enough.

I guess the whole thing is stupid and I shouldn't worry bout it cause I am easy going and I should let things go with the flow I'm going to call dusting when I'm done so I can see if he is going to the hell raisers. wow it is quiet in here with no music I want to turn on ole Kenny but ill wait 10 min left this is going by fast. I thought I was barely talking. I wish I knew her name I talk to her everyday and she is in 3 of my classes and she introduces me to people and I don't even know her name that's kinda fucked up but I could like seinfeld introduce someone and she has to say her name. that would work I wonder when seinfeld comes on its not like it matters though all I really do anymore is read and study. quiet it is never this quiet my shoulder feels weird my phone is ringing again brb oh I am talking to jb about hell raisers that was easy I'm going to his room in well 13 53sec so I can wait no 20 - 1353 well 1412 now but yeah I think I'm going to work out after the meeting. I wonder if they let anyone in that 70s show is on I hear the theme song my computer sounds weird man a guy that robyn knows or knew shot himself in the face last night. it was sad supposedly he was mad or something and his gf was fighting with him and he shot himself in the face with a pistol right in front of her. robyn felt bad but I didn't know what to say really cause she has not seen him or talked to him in a long time so to me it wouldn't have been that big of a deal. this is getting long now that I'm looking forward ahead in the direction of I'm thinking of ways to say that differently alternately substitute words my eyes are getting tired I'm not blinking I need to ok wow that burned I shut them for like 5 sec and it burned it is better now jonathan thought he broke his toe and skarke got so wasted it was funny I burped and hiccupped at the same time. I wonder what this is going to say about me I don't really care though cause I think most of psy is just unnecessary over evaluation but it is interesting on a lot of levels the lie detector was cool though I think I could beat it maybe but well that's all \"),\n",

I'm happy that I'm going to dallas to see her but last night she was making me mad by hanging around other guys and at all these parties. I like ut but I think I would have a much better time at smu with her, not only would I be with her a lot more but I like the school better and its not so overwhelming and is a lot smaller. I feel bad for lying to her the other night about having our neighbors, some girls over, but whatever I mean she goes over to guys apts to hang out and I mean since I'm the dominant male figure I guess that inviting girls over means that you like them or something. whatever it just does not register right, I mean like its cool for her to go to a guys apt, but its not for me to have chicks over, like that is not fair and Its not like I like any of these girls its just that I want to be social and have girls as friends just as much as she does. you know its weird that I have these feelings but I almost feel like I could spend the rest of my life with her. she is fun witty sexy as hell blonde rich great person in her heart and I think everything that a guy would want, although she has great things about her there is also some downsides. like in party situations I always find her wondering off and talking to her friends and when I come up to her she acts almost as if she does not know me. is she ashamed? I don't think so but it could seem that way to others. but maybe its because I do it to, I mean when I'm at a party I like to be with my friends to so I guess were both guilty. damn that movie meet the parents is funny and I want to go watch it badly and I have only typed for 10 min, o well halfway done. so its like the glass is half full not half empty because I am a positive, optimist. I like the new book jarrett gave me. sometimes I'm just real un positve about things and a book on being positive can help me out in life and with school. this interview or presentation I went to last night for this sales company was pretty cool I think I could potentially make some money doing it but as I sat there and listened to this over-energetic guy talk about oh yea you can make all this money and blah blah blah I thought to myself this is just one of those get rich quick schemes because at the end of this thing you pay 50 for a application and some of there products, what company just lets you sit through a presentation and BAM you got the job. jarrest going to do it so I think since he has been successful in his endeavors with business and sales I think hey why not give it a try what is the worst that can happen. Bud sounds good right now although I have not smoked in a while I wonder why, I guess its cause I act different when I'm stoned and maybe I don't like it, I like to get high after I workout cause for some reason it feels good and makes me feel as if I'm not just a lazy pothead, is pennebaker going to care that I'm talking about this? o well that is what is on my mind so take it or leave it jk. yea I'm almost done with this , I thought this was going to be a formal paper with research and stuff but what a badass assignment, I think I'm going to like this teacher unlike my eco teacher Wolitz I can't stand her ugly face and bad teaching I just don't like her you know just one of those ppl.

Man I've got a three hour drive ahead of me today and i made the same drive yesterday. It was soooo boring. I wish i could just warp back to Austin or something like that. But i like being back in Pearland. It's great to see my family and friends again. I miss them sometimes and the once or twice a month i get to see them are well worth it. But when my trip is over, I'm always eager to see my peeps in Austin again and just to get back to normal life. I've got a lot of reading to do this weekend and i don't want to do it. It's alll textbook reading and i would much rather be reading Dean Koontz or just not be reading at all. I wish i could type faster and that way i could type a lot. I've got to type as much as possible. Otherwise i won't be satisfied with my experiment. blankness. . i want some new CD's to listen to on the way back to Austin. that way i wouldn't get a sbored as i was yesterday. and then the ride would weem much shorter. wow i still got thirteen minutes left. i wish i could slept in longer today but i had to wake up to make sure that i would finish this in time. i don't mind doing it but i'm jsut so dang lazy that this is even annnoying to me. I'm just not good at doing things that i don't want to do. oh well. i talked to Nick last night and we talked about how things are diff. now because i moved to Austin. all he does now is go out with girls since andy is going to San Antonio and i'm already in Austin. things have changed since i moved. i can't just go over to his house anytime i'm bored anymore  it's a three hour drive if i do. i miss those guys and my family more than i thought i would  it's weird being back at home. the place seems different. my room seems foreign to me because my parents cleaned it up and moved things around the week after i left for austin. i hope i'm not getting carpal tunnel syndrome, my wrists are getting kind of sore and my arms are already sore from playing racuetball the other day. it was fun thought and i'm probly going to play again today or tomorrow. i'm looking forward to it. ahhh no more wrist pain. i hope my brother won't get mad at me for stealing his computer chair but it makes my wrists feel so much better. WOW my phones loud it just scared the crap out of me when it rang see there it is!  typing is sooo much easier whne your in a  computer chair and not a dining room chair. i wonder what you'll think when your reading this or if anyone's even going to read it. hmmmmmmm.  i need to leave pretty soon so i don't hit Houston's rush hour but there is so much stuff i need to get done with here. wow the opportunity cost sucks. three more minutes. i only got a few more minutes and then no more of this mind to page thing. after that i can just think and not have to type it up or anything ike that. i hope Pearland wins tonight and moves up in Houston's rankings and AP state rankings. they are relaly good and deserve to be high up in all rankings. likewise i hope UT kicks NC's butt tomorrow because UT IS all that and a huge bag of potato chips. then maybe they could move ahead of OU in the AP rankings because everyone knows we're better than those north of the red river weirdos  who cares about the sooners anyway. Hybl sucks and their second and third strigers are both freshmen and that's really going to hurt em bad. oh well we'll see on October 12th. GO HORNS!!! \"),\n",

It has alredy taken me a good long while to take notes on the first 17 pages. I don't know how I am going to read the rest. I am almost thinking that I should just not do it but if I did that I would feel very guilty about myself for not doing it. So I think that I am going to be pulling an all nighter trying to finish reading and taking noes on the materials. I just think that the work he put on us is a little harsh. That is a lot of work. Now my best friend from home was going to come stay with me one night this weekend. I was so excited because I haven't seen her since we both left for school, but now she is not coming but all of her friends that go to school with her now are going to come. I am so upset because I really wanted to see her. She is going back home to see her family instead. I know that she wanted to come stay with me but she just couldn't but I really wanted her here because I know that we would have had so much fun together and I wanted her to meet all of my friends. Oh well, I know that she will come to see me soon I hope. Well so far I have had a really good time here at school. I have become friends with a lot of cool people and my sister is here also.

I also want to work out just so that I feel good about myself and feel like I have done something productive for the day. I hate feeling like a slob and that is what I have felt like lately.

I really hope that I can because I am trying to make a 4. 0 this semester, to start off college on the right foot. I feel like a dork because at my dorm everyone goes out every night and I stay home and read well last night I just goofed off most of the night because I couldn\\'t concentrate. Since I don\\'t know what to expect on our first college tests I am going to make sure that keep up to date with my school work. I had a lot of fun at the Delt Pledge party this weekend though, I was a time that I went out and it was worth it. I just saw that my clock on my bedside table is 5 minutes faster than my computer; I will need to fix that in a minute because I know the computer is right. It felt better outside this morning there was a breeze and it wasn\\'t too hot. The football game is going to be horribly hot but I can\\'t wait! I really need to get back into typing. I mean that I have been making a lot of typos I hope that I am catching them. I am listening to Simon and Garfunkle I love them, one of my best friends, Hilary and I used to always sing to \"Cecilia\". Hilary goes to Tech; I haven\\'t talked to her in a while. I need to make some phone calls to my high school friends but I am sort of overwhelmed right now with school. It will be better tomorrow because I only have 2 classes tomorrow and 1 on Friday. Monday I have 4 classes, that is going to be killer! It\\'s been nice since we haven\\'t had a Monday class yet, though. I went to aerobics today and didn\\'t get a very hard work out so I tried to go to Gregory but I forgot that it isn\\'t opened until after 12:05 on weekdays because they have class in the weight room. I went to the CoOp to return 2 books but the worker told me that I needed to bring another receipt so I\\'ll have to back tomorrow. I have been trying to stay on campus on days that I have classes with breaks that are 1췆 hours or less between classes. That makes me read and eat lunch outside and so I don\\'t waste time walking home and back to class. It is a good plan but by the end of the day I am very tired. I like this writing assignment. It make me aware of what I think about randomly I guess that is the point of the project. I want to see the movie \"Bring it On\" it\\'s a cheerleader movie. I heard it was corny but that I would like it I cheered in high school and so I guess it\\'s a given that I would enjoy anything of this sort. I can\\'t wait to watch the cheerleaders, dancers, and band at the football game I love football too. It\\'s weird to me that the transition from high school to college hasn\\'t been a bigger deal to me. It sort of feels like I am at camp. I like it here. Oh, it\\'s been 22 minutes! Bye '),\n",

The lectures my prof. gives, just don't really make since. I wish that my best friend Natalie and I could've spent more time together when I was home this past weekend. I also wish that my boyfriend Mark would send me an email. I wish that we could somehow get passed this stupid problem we are having. It's hard enough him being in Virginia, then he has to go and get some weird attitude and get mad and not be himself. It is really making me mad, and sad all at once. I wish that I could see him, and knock some since into his head and then everything would be okay. Natalie is the only one that knows enough about us for me to talk to about our relationship problems. But I hate boring her to death with it, I don't want to get on her nerves about it. This past summer, everything was fine, and now it is all so different, I hate it. But there is nothing I can do about it. And then there is Matt which just gets on my nerves.

Poor guy, I feel sorry for him. Then, my mind always, swings back to Mark. I can't ever not think about us, and this problem we are having. I so need to talk to him about it because I can't function unless everything is resolved. And it is driving me absolutely CRAZY. But he won't talk about it, he won't talk to me.

       " Document(page_content=\"Towers seemed to have gotten an illness that spread very quickly last week. Only difference is everyone felt like crap for a day maybe two, I was sick for four. However, I'm feeling better so perhaps tomorrow is my last day. My mother brought some Echinacea- it's an herb that supposedly helps during the cold and flu season. I pray it does the trick. I am extremely excited about this upcoming weekend. I get to go home- Houston. Isn't that strange? You're supposed to go to college and never want to leave; here I am jumping up and down at the very thought of home. Unfortunately, the University of Texas at Austin doesn't fit like I thought it would. The university itself is awesome. My professors all seem great and the classes are interesting. The main problem exists at home- University Towers room 301. I typically refuse to stereotype- but I'll make an exception. Most people here are self-absorbed, fake, rich kids. I care more about people and their life experiences. They care more about what you drive or what your father does for a living. Oh well, at least I'm not in this alone. One of my best friends from Houston isn't content here either, except she is at ACC. My roommate, Sharon, is really sweet. (I went pot luck). She lived in Houston most her life but her dad got transferred to Holland, so she moved as well. I love hearing stories about the differences. She went to an American school so it's not like she learned Dutch, but still the opportunity was once in a lifetime. My parents moved to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil only a month ago. I was able to visit for a week early this summer and sure enough It Was Beautiful. My dad works for Houston Industries and was offered a promotion, salary increase, housing/driver paid, among other things to work in Rio. So they went to check it out and discovered it would be worth it. That's crazy to me. They are 54 years old and completely changing cultures, countries, etc. In a way I'm thrilled for them. Yet, my sadness that they're 10 hours away overcomes that. It's not all a sad story though. I have a gorgeous place to visit for Christmas vacation (there it will be spring I think) and my parents and I are going through life changes at the same time. Also, my house will still be there; my oldest brother and his wife are moving in. So I have my oh, so comfortable bed to retreat to at Thanksgiving. This is strange to me. a writing assignment that doesn't require revising and outline and spell check. Actually I like it more because I feel like I'm talking to someone. I'd much rather talk than write. English is my least favorite/worst subject. I do well in math but I don't like it. History is okay, depending if the teacher makes it exciting. Science is the best. if I weren't so crazy about dance and teaching I'd become a chemical engineer. But I believe I'd get bored of that job real quick. Well, times up.

I am feeling a bit like Doogie Howser (at the end of each episode, it is night and he normally sits at his computer and types his journals out and reflects upon the events that happened throughout the day). I am typing this in Microsoft word, because it was recommended by your little site and was repeated about 4 times. Although I have Physics tomorrow, which I have no clue what is going on in because my teacher is a bit confused himself. I am feeling relieved because I had this HUGE paper due in my freshman seminar class today and I worked my ass off for it and I feel good about it. I am not all that great of a writer but I think I will get a decent grade on it. Plus it was only a first draft, and we will have to go back and revise them and whatnot. By the time I am completely finished with the paper I am going to despise it but hey, that is how it goes, I suppose. I think it is good for a person to just sit and write or type every once and a while. I have a friend, Olga, who has gone through like 12 journals in the past 3 years. She tries to find time for it everyday. it is her relaxation and when she is really upset or depressed, once she gets everything out. she feels better. Which reminds me, I need to give her a call. I miss her. She goes to Southwest Texas. I am actually sitting on the phone with my boyfriend who is also in the class (Michael Linford). We are both typing this writing assignment at the same time. Well. I thought it was a bit humorous. I am actually in a really good mood, because my boyfriend and I actually live in the same city now. It is a really good feeling. We met last year, here in Austin at debate camp. He is from Colleyville (DallasFort Worth), so we spent just under a year living 4 hours apart from each other. All of my classes are going pretty good, although I still don\\'t really have a clue what I want to major in just yet. I am in the college of Liberal Arts (woo hoo!) and I was thinking about a double major in psychology and government. I also want to go to law school. I seriously doubt I will get into UT\\'s law school. It is way too competitive. * Sigh * who knows, I sure don\\'t. I am living at Dobie right now, and let me tell youI am getting ripped off. It is $7000 a year and I have a little room and have to walked up stairs all the time because I live on the 2nd floor (the \"intensive study floor\"), which I never signed up to be in. I guess it isn\\'t all that bad though; at least I\\'m not at Jester. I don\\'t have a car here because my parents are irrational. I have a car sitting in the garage at home but they didn\\'t want me to bring it with me because they thought it would be some sort of a \"growing experience\" for me. Although I only live around an hour or so away from here (Schertz, TX. near San Antonio) I haven\\'t been home since I have been here. I have no real desire to go home. I hated high school, well I hated it my senior year. All my friends graduated and my classes were a waste of time. I guess that is one of the reasons why I feel I can\\'t compete with some of the people here at UT, my high school didn\\'t have much to offer. I have a good friend of mine (Shala) that came and saw me the weekend before last. She is at UNT and she hates it there. Although I miss her, I think she misses me a whole hell of a lot more. She has resorted to hanging out with people from our high school that didn\\'t give her the time of day for the last 6 years of her life. Jocks and whatnot. Supposedly there is this annoying kid (who I started to resent in high schoolScott Hall) that talks to her nonstop about me. Scott and I were buds back in 8th grade and once we got to high school, I no longer existed. That happened with a lot of my jr. high friends. Back to Shala, well she told me yesterday that she has \"found God. \" If only you knew Shala, you would know that is a load of shit. If she is happy, then hey I am all for it, but I don\\'t think it is something she\\'ll stick with. I am not an atheist or anything but I just don\\'t know and don\\'t care to find out. I am not saying I won\\'t be open to opinions and respectful of one\\'s commitment and dedication but it is something that annoys me. I guess that is because of my parents. They use to force me to go to church, and my dad wouldn\\'t let me go out or do anything on Sundays unless I went (even though he would sit at home, watching football or somethinghypocrite!) Alright. I have far surpassed the 20minute limit and I\\'m out. '),\n",
       " Document(page_content='I am sitting at my computer listening to my roommate singing in the background. I can\\'t really smell anything because I\\'m getting over a cold. I\\'m thinking about last night. My sorority had a party at Antone\\'s and my date just didn\\'t show up. I\\'ve been considering for the last few hours what kind of excuse he is going to come up with this morning. Either way he owes me big time. Now I\\'m listening to the Doors, again accompanied by my roommate singing and me a little with her. I trying to think of what to write about in this stream of consciousness. I have a class today that I have to read for before 2 o\\'clock. I really don\\'t feel like reading for that class, but I guess I have to. It\\'s biology and I like the class, but I just caught up with the reading yesterday and then now we have to read a another whole chapter which I am not to excited about. My foot is starting to hurt because I was sitting on it weird, adn now it\\'s asleep. I hate the feeling you get when your foot is trying to wake back up I guess you would call it. This CD that I\\'m listening to has quite a mix on it. now we\\'re listening to the beatles. It\\'s not my CD or I would know what is on it. I wonder if they will ever completely stop illegal downloading of music on the internet. I mean there\\'s no really way that you can stop anything on the internet. It\\'s too vast and someone will allays think of a way to get around things. I have a download capability on my computer but I don\\'t use it all that often, so I doubt the people like me are the ones they are really after. I understand that some musicians are angry because it takes away from their profits, but downloading allows the person to listen to their music, decide if they like it or not, and then decide to buy the cd. Many of the songs that you download on the internet are not the best quality, so it is easier to just go out and buy the CD. I have no idea who this song playing is by. I still have exes on my hands from the bar last night, I really need to try and wash them off before I forget about it and go to class with them still on. I don\\'t like the way they write exes on your hands. Is not one hand enough? They really don\\'t need to mark both of them. I don\\'t even think you could wash them off in the bathroom of the bar if you wanted to. There would be too much of a chance that they would catch you and throw you out, which would be really embarrassing. Last night was okay, it was not nearly as much fun as I was expecting it to be. Well maybe if my date had showed up, it would\\'ve been more fun. I\\'m not too worried about it though, my boyfriend comes into town tonight so I\\'m more excited about that. He is not coming in until much later though, I wish he could come earlier. I also need to make sure my friend is going to come up for Lion Hunt, another thing that the sorority throws. Life is so hectic at college, I don\\'t ahve time to really do anything. I don\\'t know how some people do it. They can just go to class, not do any of the reading and be okay with that. If I\\'m behind in a class it bothers me until I get it done. Then after I sit down and do the reading or the homework, everything\\'s so much better. All I did yesterday afternoon was read. I\\'m caught up in psychology and journalism finally. But then next week, the cycle starts all over again. I guess that\\'s why I feel like I\\'m never caught up completely. We\\'re listening to School\\'s Out for Summer\", I wish it was! But that won\\'t happen for a very very long time. But I had fun this summer. I didn\\'t have a job, so I got to do whatever I wanted. It was fun. I really need to straighten up my room, it\\'s got clothes everywhere. They\\'re all clean but thrown around from when I was trying to figure out what to wear last night. I need to go to the grocery store too, I\\'m out of bottled water and drinks. I need to get more hangers too. Ok enough of this random writing, my 20 minutes are up. '),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"Okay, I am starting to write for this assignment. I don't really know what I'm supposed to write, but I guess it's sort of like a journal and I'm supposed to write whatever I am thinking. I am kind of overwhelmed by school right now. It is so big here, and it's kind scary. I'm used to knowing everyone around, but here I don't know anyone. Friends is on right now. It's pretty funny. I miss being in Houston where everything is normal. I'm not used to the times shows come on here. This sounds really stupid, like I am just rambling on about nothing. Friends is funny. Am I doing this right? I don't know if this is what y'all are asking me to do. I miss John, the guy I am dating from Houston. I don't really want anything serious with him, but I like him a lot so I am kind of confused on what I should do. Should I have my fun and not date someone I really like a lot, or should I date him and maybe miss out on opportunities to have fun at school. I don't know I am not sure. And then there is my exboyfriend Ricky. I don't want to be with him, but sometimes I miss him. I think it is only when I think back on high school I think about the good times we had and I miss that. I also don't like it that maybe I made the wrong choice in not wanting him and moving on. What if I totally regret it in the future, and I want him back, but he doesn't want me. That would be horrible. I don't know. I'm just pretty confused right now. I don't know what I want about anything. It's hard getting used to everything around here. I miss the show 90210. I was just thinking about it for some weird reason. That used to be my favorite show, but it got cancelled. I'm supposed to go to a frat party tonight but I don't know if I'm going to go or not. My roommate doesn't want to go cause she needs to do work. She's the same major as me. She's a pretty good influence on me. She gets me to go to meetings and stuff that I probably wouldn't go to if it weren't for her dragging me to them. I am filming the volley ball game on Saturday for a live broadcast. I'm glad I am getting involved somehow. I tried to get tickets to the OU game, but I couldn't they were already sold out when I was supposed to get them. I'm pretty bored right now. I probably have lots of grammar mistakes in here, but since I'm free writing, I don't think it really matters. At least I hope it doesn't matter. I'm a little scared about grades. I hope tests and stuff are not too hard. I'm not really thinking about anything right now, so I have nothing to right except that I have nothing in my head. This is a little hard; to right only what you are thinking and not thinking of something to write. I'm glad it rained today, it was nice. I love the rain. Ever since I was a life guard I have loved the rain, cause we got to close the pool and sit around getting paid for doing nothing a miss those days, back in the summer of my freshmen year. Everything was so easy back then, it kind of makes me sad thinking about it, but oh well, I guess I'll make new memories, and have a different kind if fun. Okay, well my time is up. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"It is just past one a. m. and I feel like doing this now. I'm not really tired and know that I should go to bed because I have to go to class at eight tomorrow. I've done all of my homework and am extremely bored. I just got off the internet with my boyfriend back at home, which would be Conroe. He's lonley just like me and we have been talking for about three hours. I miss him a lot and don't quite know what to do. I really don't have a lot of friends here. I had seven best friends that I grew up with since around fourth grade and all seven of them went to A&M. I really feel left out. They all e-mail me and tell me what a great time they are having and I wish I were with them. I've wanted to come here since I was in fifth grade though, so this is a dream come true for me. I just wish I had someone to talk to. They were always there for me and we always had a great time. I also miss my family, which is probably to be expected in the first weeks of college. My brother called me today, he is 13, and told me that he just got a new dwarf hamster and I know he got it just because I told him last week that they were the cutest things. He takes everything I say to heart, even if he dosen't know it. My mom's and my brother's birthday is in a week and I'm not sure if I can get home. I wasen't able to bring my car up here so I'm stuck at the mercy of my roommate. I just want to be there for their birthday's. If my roommate dosen't go home though then I'm stuck up here. I've known Sara for quite a long time. For about eight years. We've never really been best friends or anything but we decided to room together because we knew we could trust each other. She is pretty neat, although she does complain a lot. I have really nothing against here though. I'm kinda hungry, if you would like to know that. Instead of eating dinner I went down the hall and watched the MTV music awards and ate candy and popcorn and I'm still hungry. I don't want to have to get up in the morning. When I scheduled my classes I should not have put four classes in one day, but I had no choice. I'm really regretting it now though. Homework is hard to do if it all has to be done on the same day. I'm also taking an aerobics class and it is quite fun. I never expected it to be so physical though. I know you are supposed to exercise and all, it's just that it hurts. I am so out of shape and it just makes me aware of that fact. My eyes are getting all fuzzy. And it is very cold. I'm getting tired now and I think it is because of all the blue writing on the white background. I wasen't tired before. So, my twenty minutes is almost up and I might go to bed now. I doubt it, I am a night person. I'd rather stay up all night and sleep all day. That would be great. Well, I'll talk to you in the next writing assignment. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Today was a pretty good day. I had only one class and then I had the chance to take a nap. I was so tired. And I am not sure why. I mean I know why, I am up until late on the phone every night with Danny but I should be getting used to that right? I think that after over a year of talking on the phone that late I would be used to it. I miss him so much. I wish he were here with me. It seems like everything that I do or see or hear reminds me of him. Sometimes I have a hard time concentrating in class because I am thinking about him. That is not a good thing; I mean I need to concentrate on my work and my studies. Sometimes I feel guilty because I feel like I miss him more than I miss my family. Is that bad? I mean I feel like it shouldn't be that way. But I love him so much. I constantly wonder if we will end up being together forever. I really think this could be the one. I am really nervous though about even telling my parents about how serious we are. I mean they must suspect something but I know they would never guess exactly how serious we are. I always wished I could tell my parents more than what I do but I never have felt like we have any kind of connection in that respect. It seems like all my good friends have that and I am defiantly jealous about that. I mean Laura, my roommate, has that with her mom. She can tell her mom anything. Why is it that I never felt like I could talk to my mom? I will never do that with my kids, I mean when I have kids I am going to keep that line of communication open. I mean I don't think they want me to be their best friend or anything and that doesn't faze me but I would like to be able to talk to them about the daily gossip at school or the party they went to last weekend or their boy/girl problems. I think that if Danny and I do stay together, he would make a great father. I mean he has the same opinions as me about raising kids and all that. I mean that is a lot of the reason we are so good together. We think alike and we know what the other one is thinking. Something I just thought about is our friends. I like his friends, and they like me. But it seems that some of my good friends just don't think highly of Danny. I mean it is upsetting. Liv makes me mad because she thinks she knows what is going on and she thinks that I could do better, I constantly tell her that she couldn't know. She doesn't know Danny like I do and she doesn't know the type of relationship that Danny and I have. Jill usually is pretty positive about things with Danny and I and so is Laura. Matt it seems never is. But Matt is a whole other story. I don't talk to Matt all the time anymore being that he still is back in San Antonio. One thing I can't stand about Matt is his constant mood changes. It is just so hard for me to deal with that sometimes. And it seems like no matter what happens he always knows what is going on between Danny and me and if he doesn't he asks me and expects that I am just going to tell him. What does he think I am stupid? He can't keep a secret and that bugs me. I mean if I tell a good friend of mine something that I think is personal, I would expect them not to say anything. The problem is that I don't always tell them not to say anything but I would hope being that they are my best friend they would be able to figure that out on their own. I think that is not too much to ask. Just the other day Matt asked what Danny and I did the other night. That is none of his business and I tell him that and he still pries. What is his problem? Sometimes I wonder how Matt and I have stayed friends for so long, and good friends at that. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"I can't believe I am doing this, and that I actually am getting through it, because this is the first time that I have ever logged on to the world wide web, at least I think that is what you call it. To tell you the truth it is actually easier than I thought it would be, I expected it to be very difficult, but it's not all that bad. Anyhow all this computer stuff is fairly new to me and so it is rather confusing for me at times. But I guess I am coping with it and handling it the best I can. Though I am always afraid that I will hit one button and the whole place will shut down. Actually, that is a true nightmare that I have had before. Which reminds me that I have been having really strange dreams lately, and all of them concern a different aspect of school. Which I guess is because I have just moved here from a really small town. And when I say small, I mean really , really small, like about fifteen hundred people in the whole town. Now compared to that Austin is a real shocker. I guess it just takes some getting used to , and learning new things when you move from a farm to a fast paced city. So many things are different and yet so many things are the same. A funny thing happened when I first moved here a week ago, I found out that my cousin, she is the same age as me, is living in the apartment directly above mine. to me this is such a coincidence, really when you think about it is. Just think of how many apartment buildings there are in Austin, and I unknowingly chose the exact same one that she did. And she and I only used to see each other once a year, but now we see each other nearly every day. Christmas, when our families all got together was the only time we saw each other,  I am already looking forward to the Christmas season because of the weather that we have at that time. I am so tired of this ninety degree weather. I can't wait for a cold spell or a norther to blow in and cool everything off. But I guess that won't happen for a while yet anyway. That reminds me that I have to pick up a raincoat or an umbrella before this weekend, because I am planning to go to my youngest brothers football game, and I want to be prepared in case it happened to rain. More than likely it won't rain, but I know that If I don't get a raincoat or umbrella then sure enough it will pour. I don't usually enjoy watching football games, actually I don't ever enjoy watching it, but my brother begged me and begged me to come see him, so I finally told him that we would come watch him this Friday. he's supposed to be really good. But I don't even remember what position he plays anymore. The reason that I don't really like football is that I don't understand the rules very well, and I think that if I knew them better then I would be able to follow along with the game better and enjoy it much more. I am not much of a person who likes sports and athletics much anyway. I like to do more calm, less active things. One of my really good friends happens to be getting married this weekend. I wonder what the wedding will be like, considering the man she is marrying is so strange. I wonder how long that marriage will last. But I am glad to be going to her wedding, because I will be able to see all of my old friends from high school again, and catch up with what they are doing now. I haven't seen them is a really long time so that should be interesting. Well, I am way past my twenty minutes, and must get to class, so I must end here. \"),\n",

THe music that I am listening to right now is very loud. I wonder if I should go to class today. I am very lucky to have checked the web page today because there is a lot of information that I didn't know about. The test coming up on the 15th worries me because I am not sure what it will be over or what to study. My forearm is already beginning to cramp up while I am typing. my leg itches. I like this song that is coming on now. My eyes are very tired. my head itches and I have to scratch it. I think I need to stretch my neck. I really need to start getting more sleep since I have been at college my sleep habits have been horrible. There is something under my foot that is bothering me. I wonder how long I have been typing for. Only five minutes. Now I am feeling like this is going to take forever. It is kind of dark in the room that I am in. I'm thinking about pizza. now I am thinking about the girl who's room I am in. She is in the shower. I ate pizza with her for lunch. She is very beautiful. She sure has been in the shower for a long time. Dave Matthew's songs all sound alike to me. I can't get over how everyone loves that guy like he is the beatles of the 90's or something. My mind has gone blank for a second. What time is it now. Only 8 minutes. How come all girls are getting belly buttons rings. If I was a girl I wouldn't get one. That would hurt and why go through that pain. I think the music is getting louder. Cell phones!  Everybody is getting those too. And they keep getting smaller. That reminds me of Lethal Weapon 4 when Chris Rock complains that they are only making them smaller so they are easier to lose so that you have to buy more phones and they make more money. I can't think of anything. I am wondering if I really have to do this. Time check. 12 minutes. It is hot. It smells like austin water. The water in austin is really hard and always dries out my skin. I need a chair in my room so when I watch tv I don't have to sit on my bed because that hurts my back. My back is hurting right now. Basketball caused my back problems. I should be playing basketball right now. Everybody thinks I am obsessed with basketball because I talk about it a lot but when you love something shouldn't it be on your mind a lot. I want to be a basketball coach. I can't imagine going to a job everyday and be thinking about basketball behind some desk where I can't play or coach. I have to be a coach or I won't enjoy my job. This girl kim drops everything on her feet. I swear to god she has burned herself with her curling iron six times six times since I have been here. sHe just interupted my train of thought.

       " Document(page_content=\"Well I have been thinking about a dream I had last night which was bothersome. I have only vomitted twice in my life and so my dream had to do with me throwing up all over the place and in my dream I was trying to wake up from the dream because I don't like throwing up. I was also thinking about all of my school work. I am very frustrated with the pre-testing website because I can never get on it. There always seems to be some sort of technical difficulty, and I don't know what to do about it and so I came up with one solution and that is to get Netscape Navigator but that also didnt work out like I had hoped. So I tried to see if there was a problem with my Internet provider so that whole thing is causing a lot of frustration for me. Well I don't like thinking about it too much because I am hoping sometime between now and September 11th my problem willl be solved. I am also overwhelmed in my spanisk 312L class which my last semester of a language and it is very difficult and I dread going to class every MWF from 12-1. As I am writing this I keep thinking about how the instructions of this assignment says not to worry about grammar but I still have to make sure that I haved spelled every word correctly not so much the punctuation but the spelling. This assignment is very fun for me. Also I am thinking about the conversation my roommates and I had last night about God right after we were discussing God in class on Monday. We had a two or so hour conversation about death and God after I had stated that the ONE subject that I do not like talking about is death. So ofcourse we talk about death and then we go on to have a deep conversation which is something I enjoy doing from time to time just to see what other people feel about certain topics. I am also constantly thinking about guys that I used to know in high school and the one or two that are a year younger than me that I still talk to and that have at one point or another had an attraction to but don't know what will come of it meaning whether or not I will stay friends with the two boys as time goes on. I am also thinking about what is going on on the television show that is on in my room. It has to do with sexual harassment and it is the guy accusing the woman of sexual harassment at a Dominos Pizza Company. And he won the landmark case. It is funny because the comedy show that was on prior to the present show had to do with the same issue. Well that is all --- This assignment was very pleasing to me because I enjoy doing assignment like this. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='I am sitting here wondering as to why I chose to do this assignment at this particular time. As I search my the thoughts the number one reason I can find is BOREDOM. I am so bored right now, as I have throughout my entire UT experience. I miss my friends, my family, my surroundings, my house, and most of all, my king size water bed. I have nothing against my roommate, my dorm, or this college, but I feel that they cannot replace the friends, accommodations, and schools that I have become accustomed to over the past 18 years. I\\'m pretty sure that I just used a runon sentence. Five minutes down, fifteen to go. Notice that I spelled out the words \"FIVE\" and \"FIFTEEN\" in order to waste. I am wasting this time because I don\\'t feel any need to be introspective. I feel that I know myself pretty well, both strengths and weaknesses, I that I have no need to further analyze my thoughts. I am very surprised how painless that has bee thus far. I\\'m sure that my high school English teachers would die when if they saw how many sentences I started with \"I\". Although you can not see this, thanks to the wonders of modern technology, it just took me about eight tries to correctly spell the word \"saw\". Did you notice that I also spelled out the word EIGHT. It has now been twelve minutes and it is time for a short bathroom break. I hope that this writing is still here when I come back. I\\'m back. That took about a minute. Sorry. I meant to right ONE minute. I wonder what other people are writing for this assignment. I wonder how many people will try to suck up by complementing the professor, or how many will tell of their dislike for this class? I wonder how many will try to be introspective and artistic, and end up writing free verse poetry? I feel that such people, who think themselves to be deep and philosophical, are the exact opposite, fake and shallow. I feel that my fingers are not fast enough to keep up with my thoughts. As this assignment comes to an end I wonder what I was supposed to have learned, for I feel that I am none the wiser. TWENTY minutes have now passed. The END. '),\n",

Man it just seems like all he ever does is play on his stupid computer and he's getting mean now. He was really mean when I asked him about the fire drill the other day because he's probably fake like that like Paul Gosh Paul annoys the crap out of me I hope he doesn't come to UT because that would just be horrible. But knowing my luck he's going to come to UT and that would just be great Kenny's a pretty good roommate but I think he might be getting annoyed with me or something because I sleep later than he does and I think I talk more than he does something is wrong with him too because he never talks now I look at him differently for some strange reason and I want to be a bad kid again rather than the 'good' Christian boy I used to be I want a tattoo and I want some piercings hmmm that would be cool and my classes are okay but I have this guilty feeing and I don't know why I don't know if my friends here are true or not, maybe it's better if I just keep to myself more because I have this bad feeling that I haven't really met someone that's truly there you know I mean Debra is nice and all but still I think she might be fake and Sing just uses me he looks like a damn alien it's so gross ahhh I have to wash my face in a few seconds after I'm done with this because I think I'm getting acne again and that would just be horrible I though asians weren't supposed to get acne.

       " Document(page_content=\"College is awesome. There are so many good-looking girls. The atmosphere is free and open. I wish we didn't have class so I could go out and party every night. Partying has been fun. I get drunk, but I know my limit. I go where ever the party. Free beer is always good. I don't understand why the Asians frats have a cover charge to get in. There is not a lot of alcohol, and the parties suck. Although I'm Asian, I can't stand them. Asian guys dress weirdly, and the girls look funny. I associate myself with the whites. I grew up in a white neighborhood. I didn't have a white friend until I moved to Texas which was 5 years. I only have a handful of Asian friends. Whites are a lot more fun to hang out with. They're more open and do whatever. I prefer my girlfriend to be white. In the past, I had 3 white girlfriends and 1 Asian girlfriend. Right now, I would like a white one, but I'm going after an Asian one. She is not like the others. She doesn't really like Asians either. She is half Japanese and half Vietnamese. I am half Chinese and half Vietnamese. She also happens to be in the same pyschology class. She sits next to me most of the times. I always sit next to my best friend, Zach. He is cool. He knows when to party. I have a lot of friends in there, and most of them are from Taylor High School. There so many Taylor students in there and at UT. That reminds me, the girl who sat next to me today would not quit laughing. At first, I thought she was cool. Things changed as the lecture progressed. The girl who sat in the row behind me, 5 seats to the right wearing the red Hilfiger shirt was good looking. I wish I was white so I could approach white girls with better ease. Man oh man. There so many pretty girls in that class. Microeconomics has a lot too. Especially the one two rows down from me. I normally sleep in that class, but she kept me awake. Damn. I wish I approached her. Kinsolving is an excellent place to eat. A lot of girls eat there. My parents are bringing up my bike on Saturday, and I'm excited. I definitely need a bike. They'll probably take me shopping and out to lunch. I probably take my roommate and woman along. My roommmate is pretty cool. Could be an asshole at times, but who isn't?  We went to school together. We have three classes together including pysch. Right now, I'm pissed at Edwin. He is one of my friends and is also in the pysch class. He won't shut up. He is starting to get annoying. He says a lot of stupid things. He doesn't like UT or something. When he is wrong, he will try to do some bullshit that makes him look right. Such an idiot. My Eco teacher is so stupid. Such an FOB.

       " Document(page_content=\"Basically right now I am feeling a little bit stressed out. I have to go to this Fiesta tonight for my sorority and I think it will be really fun, but we have to dress up. I have no idea yet what I am going to wear. On top of all of that I have class pretty much all day today. My Freshmen Seminar is really interesting, but we stayed last week for the entire 3 hours and that is just kind of a long time to be hearing about libraries. For some reason I am also feeling kind of overwhelmed by school. I don't know if I am behind or if I will be prepared for the tests or what. I always thought that I would have so much more time in college because I wouldn't be at school for 9 hours a day, but for some reason I never seem to have enough time. And wow, right now I am really tired. I wanted to try to get to sleep kind of early last night so I could wake up early today and get some things done, but of course that didn't happen. I'm also pretty hungry so I need to decide on something to have for lunch. We really need to go to the grocery store because we don't really have any good food. I could go eat in the cafeteria, but for some reason I don't just love that food. I mean it's not really bad, but I just don't really like everything that they  have downstairs. I'm really glad that we have the kitchens in Towers because I like being able to make my own food. Now I'm back to worrying about what I am going to wear tonight. I should have thought about this a lot sooner. I tried to go get something yesterday, but I couldn't find anything. From now on I am going to get all of my costumes together much sooner. My problem is that everyone always goes to do all of that stuff in the afternoon and I always have class in the afternoon. Oh well though! I'm pretty excited about tonight, but I really just don't want to stay out too late. And then one of my friends from high school is coming in to town on Friday so I think that should be really fun. I'm excited to see her. I've been feeling randomly kind of homesick lately, but I am going home for a visit in like 2 weeks and I can't wait! Now I am seriously getting so hungry. As soon as I finish this I am going to make some lunch and I then I have to do some reading. Reading is really the only homework I have, but it is so time consuming and I feel like I always kind of put it off. I don't know why I feel like that because I am not really behind in my reading or anything. oh my, my alarm clock is going off and that is really annoying, I guess I never turned it off. I wonder if there is anyone here. I know my roommate is at class, but I'm not sure whether my suitemates are here or not. It's really quiet so I'm thinking maybe not. I am definitely going to go get a Coke and some lunch after I finish with this. I am so tired, maybe the Coke will wake me up a little bit. Goodness, I just wish I knew what I was going to wear tonight. I think maybe I'll call my sister later and see what she thinks. I just don't know though. My Zeta Bud never called me which is strange, but I can't go to the activity today anyway because I have class. Oh well. I think someone just walked in. I wonder which one of my roommates is here. I will have to go check on that and then I have a lot to do before my class at 2. I also need to find a map to where I am supposed to go for my Seminar discussion today. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Well, my first thought is that I don't quite understand this activity. I'm not sure if you want me to tell you my thoughts, as in a journal, or just irrevelant thoughts that pop into my head as I type, therefore I'll just write a journal entry. Well, right now I'm mad at my friend because she seems to be choosing her boyfriend over me to hang out with, so I guess that would make me jealous. And it doesn't help the fact that she and her boyfriend are the only two people at UT that I know. Another feeling that I'm experiencing is sadness and homesickness. I just talked to my best friend, who is attending the University of North Texas, and she was describing to me how much fun she is having and how many friends she is making-this makes me sad because I know that she is having more fun than I am. I think jealousy has a little to do with that also. I talk to my parents almost every day, and they describe their everyday life to me, and I feel left out almost, because I can't be there with them. I miss the normalcy of home. I miss waking up in the morning and knowing who my friends are, and what to expect in my classes. I know that things will change, I'm just really anxious for that to happen. Sometimes I doubt if I made the right decision by coming to UT. Would things be different if I were at UNT with my best friend?  I know things would be better. I was always afraid that if I went to UNT, my best friend would think that I was going there only because I couldn't make friends anywhere else. I only decided to come here to UT because they have an outstanding business department, and I plan to major in Management Information Systems(MIS). I'm a little overwhelmed right now because it seems like there is so much to do. In every single class so much is expected of you. It will just take a little time to get used to everything. I don't adapt well to change-I'm very much a habitual person. \"),\n",

I've had a pretty good day though, I love UT. My classes seem okay and I'm sure I'll do fine. I don't feel at all homesick, which is good. My parents miss me so much though and I feel bad for that. I'm going home this weekend even though I don't want to, but that's okay. I don't think I'm doing this right. no one will probably ever read this so why should I care. I feel like such a number at this school, but I am determined to change that. I feel like I'm writing in my journal. Emily and Annie are over here too and they brought their homework. I wish I had brought mine. I am so afraid that I'm going to get behind in my classes and not make good grades. I want a gpa of 3. 5 or better. Maybe it was stupid to set a goal that high, but that's good for me because last year I could have done a lot better. I don't regret it though, I had a very nice senior year. This year I want to study very hard though and be able to say I tried my hardest. I also want to get a PhD in psychology. I don't know why though because I just want to be a housewife. I love the idea of people calling me Dr. Hutchins though, that would be so cool. Being a medical doctor is waht my heart desires, but I can't stand the sight of blood. that causes a problem. So, I figured I'd help people another way. If I do work I want to be a child psychologist. I have a passion for kids and want to help as many as I can. That's why I want to be a housewife, so I can be with my kids all day. I'm getting tired of typing now, it should have been 15 min, not 20. I wonder what other people are going to type about. My back is hurting from sitting like this so I'm going to stop. it's been 20 min anyway. I feel weird writing something for school and not using any kind of format, but I really enjoyed it because I hate English with a passion. I took two years of AP English and I didn't pass the AP test my junior year. didn't bother taking it my senior year. Alright goodbye :)  \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"     So here I sit in my room just wondering about this asignment and and what it is I'm really thinking, well. I'm thinking of days that seem so far from where I am, the hope of the past I guess you could say. I'm wondering about the possiblitys of the future, I'm thinking about what a friend once asked me not to long ago,   what is your purpose for living?  . I told her I had none. That today I awoke for no other reason than the hope of tommarrow. This was a lie of course, I have purpose, a goal, just one that I am now comming to relize I can't reach. So what do I do?  I think thats what I'm think about most, what now. I'm also injoying a beautiful view outside my window of a world rolling by, sun shining, others walking by, and I wonder what story they have to tell. I need a cigeret. Hold on. God bless nicotine. It is wonderful drug. Many of my friends worry about me dieing because of it, but hey, what am I going to do today about it, nothing. I can fix it tommarrow, maybe thats the root of my bad timming, that always just wait for some other time. I'm considering what I should do about the Z delima, to go friday and just be in a state of medium pain, or to go do something else, something fun. God I hate her friends, and all there insocients and Nieveness, if thats a word. I really don't think I can handle there crap, and I deffinatly can't handle matt trying to be everyones friend, and the center of atention and honestly I don't know what to do. I'd like to go off on him tell him what I think of him and all his crap but I don't think it's my place, well not yet anyway. I need to go buy books. But I probly wait until tommarrow. hehe. Anyway. So there I was in the mists of a great opertunity and I didn't let it pass me by and yet I'm still here. Whats up with that. What is the point of endless philsphy of optimisum if nothing ever comes of it. A whole spewing of quotes just entered my mind, but I really don't feel like typing them. Ok. Now what. I see myself at a quite a problematic state in my life, no where to go, nothing to do,   never felt so alone, never felt so alive.  but then again. But there must be a way, a path, a right choice, but I just don't see it, no clear cut answer, well at least not one to my liking anyhow. A regular Kobi oshi Maro, no win sinerio. Well crap!   What to do. I have very few options at this point, go no go, wait see, leave, forget remember, give, take, sacrifice, avenge. What to do?  Well there is always another option, a path less taken. Away out. I just don't see it, I need to see it, need to free the mind of the wants and needs of myself, seperate, and ingage. What to do?  Ok, best case sinerio I don't do anything, just go with the flow, and most likly I'll get shit. I do something and things are only worse. I leave, and I make everyone pissed. Give and I hurt, take and I hurt others, forget. If I could forget I think I would, but you know, that really never works for me. I can hide, I can wait, but to forget, to let go. never been something I'm good at. I have gotten lots of advise, all of it the same, wait and see. but that just doesn't work for me, though there really is no other alternitive. So I go, I say hello, I leave. Thats what I'll do, and then, I'll go get drunk, always a good idea, yes. Ok so now what. I'm think of writting, but still feel really burnt out after the summer of writting, and all that crap. I really don't have anything to say either. I mean really what is there to say, I'm sad, I'm not at the top of my game. But that will all change, and I think that frustrates me. That there are no absolutes, that given time everything will not be as it is. Some thing will be, but there is always the possiblity for change, the question becomes what do I do to influence change, how do I minpulate the forces that are present in my own life, ussally I'm very good at that, but lately, I guess it's just to complex right now, no conret ansers to what and when and where, and how.

       " Document(page_content=\". Stream of consciousness well, in other words, free association. I can accommodate this assignment. It's amazing what some of the most ordinary things or objects can really do if studied. As I was walking home from a stressful day of calculus, chemistry, and psychology, I passed a squirrel searching for food on one of the lawns of a building. The animal was wandering curiously close to the sidewalk where students were walking. On normal circumstances, squirrels and other such rodents would run away as fast as possible on first sight of humans. However, this squirrel continued to hunt for food as I walked by it. I stopped and watched it, it would insert his nose and mouth into the ground and bite at some apparent food object, try it and eat it if the food object was of any value to the rodent. Curious I continued to watch, wondering what else it would do. I approached the squirrel, closer and closer. When I had come too close the squirrel dove into the ground, attempting to camouflage itself with its grassy surroundings. Fantastic! I never knew that squirrel had the notion of of trying to camouflage or hiding itself. I had always thought they would run and jump away. I remained crouched on the sidewalk as I continued to watch this curious little squirrel. After some time it started slowly approaching me. I continued to watch it, much like a predator stalking its prey. Without motion or movement I crouched and stared at it. It came to within 18 inches of me. How wonderful! The squirrel wasn't afraid to come towards a human. It remained there for a couple of moments until other pedestrians walked by and frightened the squirrel. Of course during my observation process many people walking to and fro classes walked by me and gave me awkward glances. I was so completely lost in the amazing little squirrel. At one point it had left its territory and wandered onto the street, it found a mass of dumped bread. The rodent gripped a piece with its mouth and ran back across the street to its territory. Once there the squirrel began to eat. After eating half of the portions, he began digging into the ground trying to find a strategic location to hide the bread. Not finding a place, I began to try to help. I grabbed a nearby twig and started digging into the ground to make some spots for the squirrel. I realized I was destroying the landscaping and garden of the lawns of the building. I was trying to help my new little friend. Finally, after several unsuccessful attempts the squirrel ran up into a tree after being frightened by other people. I felt anger, why would someone do that, I'm interacting with this squirrel. After it ran into the tree, it didn't come back down. At some point I left. In retrospect, I think I spent almost 40 minutes observing the squirrel. I was stressed before beginning my observations and interactions, but afterwards, amazingly, I was calm and I actually had an enjoyable time playing with it. I also learned quite a bit about the behavior of the squirrel. I never knew that they were as smart as I observed, I also realized even more what incredible running, jumping and climbing skills those pesky rodents have. Some may have viewed my time spent with the squirrel a complete waste, but it was actually quite relaxing and enlightening. Many new experiences have enlightened me to some of the lesser seen wonders of this world. A squirrel having so many complexities. Amazing. What about the human being or the human mind. The complexities of the mind and brain are endless or almost impossible! So many questions. It's almost mind boggling thinking about what can be so deep or interesting. Wow very very crazy. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"I don't know what I'm doing tonight. There's a Cory Morrow concert at the Midnight Rodeo place on Ben White. I have no idea how I would get there. Maybe I could get my ex-girlfriend to take me, but that'd be pretty weird. I was just looking online and saw that some OU/UT tickets are going for like $2000. I don't know what people were thinking when they didn't get reserved season football tickets. I just had to go up to the line once and got all my tickets for the entire season, including the OU/UT game. Pretty cool. Ya, Mike's getting upset at me cause I'm not going to College Station this weekend. Instead, I'm going to go see Jerry Jeff Walker in Gruene on Saturday. God, I hate this Nashville country thing. I got to change the radio station. It's upsetting. I wonder where my roomate Houston is. He was supposed to be back around 4:30 and he still hasn't showed up. Oh well. I got all of my calculus homework except for like 2 problems done, so that's pretty cool. I wish he would clean his side of the room a little more. I want to go play soccer tonight at Clark Field, but they're like watching American Pie 2 tonight. That's really cool. Oh well. Haha, it's only been four minutes? This is going to take forever. I can't wait to go back to St. Joe for homecoming. I want to go to the alumni party before the game. Supposedly, it's pretty fun. They don't really mind at all if you're underage. Haha. My leg is hurting because I'm pressing it up against the table while i write. What other homework do I have to do tonight? Hm. . . Oh, I have to print out some Spanish worksheets. My computer keeps humming at odd intervals. I wonder what's going on there. I can't find a decent radio station that I can recieve in my dorm. I'm going to put some music from Kazaa on. Haha, just kidding. Travis Tritt- It's a Great Day to be Alive just came on. Haha. I hope ya'll don't really care about grammar and all that because I'm just trying to write quickly without caring about that kind of stuff. This song reminds me of Garner State Park. That was a blast. They have these dances every night and most people at the park go there. It's awesome. My buddies and I met all these cute girls from Baytown, or something like that. All I know is that I want to go to Baytown sometime! haha. My bed isn't too comfy. It could be a lot nicer. I need to fix that somehow. Great, this song is ending. I wonder what's next. Haha, a little Kazaa is next. You ever listened to   Me and Billy the Kid   by Pat Green? Let me tell ya, it's a good song. I wish I could play the fiddle that well. I need to sign up for a music course next semester on how to play the fiddle . That'd be cool. I suck at it now, but being good at it wouldn't be bad. haha. Only halfway done. I wonder how much people write in these things. I bet reading them is pretty darn interesting. Haha i held back with the   darn   right there. haha. Anyways, I don't want to do calculus. The fiddle sounds really cool in this song. Here's the solo. IT soudns awesome. Seriously, download the song and listen to the solo. You'll like it. . . if you're a Texan. . haha. I hate Antonian high school. My buddy sent me a link to a webpage of theirs, and they were all proud of having made it to the state semis in baseball. Funny thing is, they lost in the first round of playoffs. We had the same records last year (need to change song again) but they went to playoffs because they had a better head to head record. We lost to them both times in the bottom of the last inning. You have no idea how upset we were. A freaking junior dropped a fly ball in the outfield to give them the tying run. I'm still pissed about that, but oh well. This song is awesome. Southbound 35 by Pat Green. It talks about coming back to Texas when he's leaving in Kansas. It's pretty cool. So what else. . I don't know how I'm getting to the OU game. I got to find a ride, maybe with Amy. Homework is no fun. Haha. I love it when they mention Austin in songs. It's pretty cool. I have to clean my room. I need to call whats that place. Midnight Rodeo and ask about the cover and when Cory goes on stage. Hope it's not much. College is quite expensive man. I love this part. Ya. . we were. soutbound 35!. . haha. New song coming. . I feel like a little Palo Alto, Naked Sorority Girls. The lyrics in that one are pretty funny. A Sigma Chi guy showed me this song during Rush Week. They're too expenisve. I think Delta Sig is the way to go. They're cool. This song has an awesome beat. Haha almost done. This actually went by pretty fast. What to do after? Maybe find someone who knows how to do those calculus problems. But when it comes to love, its all Greek to me! haha. . . I love this song. Well this has been fun. Adios till next time. \"),\n",

I am also really tired, and I know that I am not going to be getting much sleep anytime soon. I am frustratd about my computer. I need toget everything hooked up but I have to wait until someone helps me. My roommate is very messy and I think I will not be able to handle it for much longer. I wonder why my parents haven't called, and what my boyfiend did last night. I am excited about this weekend. I can't wait until the football game. I am nervous about a Pre-cal quiz. I need to get a hold of my professor, but I don't know if I can. I also need to start reading. Too much to do and not enough time to do it. I should of prepared earlier. I'm trying to think about what else is going through my mind and I'm having troubles doing so because that's all I'm thinking about. I'm wondering how hard my classes are going to be. I am excited about this class and my speech class, but not chemistry and Pre-cal. I am reallt worried about my Pre-cal class I need to go to tutoring or something. I have 5 more minutes to type. I feel like I am different from some of the girls in my sorority, and that scares me. The whole sorority thing is overwhelming. Once everything gets started things could get better. I feel like I am writing in a diary that people are going to read. I think I worry too much. I wish that life could be easier. I feel sorry for my parents. I hate community baths.

I like it when my roomate is not there sometimes and I am here alone I like being alone. I am currently having a brain blank. I am full because  I just ate lunch with my friends and now the bottom of this hard wook chair is pressing into my ankle bone and is killing me. ouch.

I am very tired and I should sleep but I need to do this assignement which I have sadly put off already too lonf. haveing an 8am math clas sis not fun and I hate it. but the material is easy so far. I am bored and tired and I feel like going home but I can't my roomate is going home and I will be here alone all weekend. well we are rarely alone becase all of my freinds come to our dumb room all the time which sometime is annoying because we don't get stuff done soemtimes. this new song is itersting. I love music. I am sleepy. but man the lyrics are so dumb. what is the deal with all this insipid lyrics. I don't know what else to wreite. I think amybe my mind is slow because I just ate and I'm sleepy and I can't think very clearly. there really isn't much to think about. I am happy that my friend is coming to visit us here he lives off campus and we don't get to see him too often. but hes really cool. I feel happy to be able to see him. I feel comfortable with him. I really like my room. this commercial is really dumb I wonder if they even make impressions on anyone. I feel bad for putting this assginment off for so long. I don't usually do this I often wonder if  I will pull the 3. 5 I need this semester I hope I do. I think I am overall happy here in austin but I get lonely someimee even tho I am surrounded by my friends. but they are my high school friends. writing for 20 minutes about nothing in particular is harder than it sound si guess. I can't think of anything to write. my mind is blank. all I am thinking baout is typing. which I am not doing very well. I miss my parents! woah what a comment but I think I do. which is cool I guess but it has ony been like 3 weeks I don't know what to think I wonder what football game is next (NFL) I think we are playing the redskins soon. I think tis radio station is terrible. my roomate souild be be back in like 30 mih\\\\nutes. man I dotn have anything to say.

I have 4 minutes left. write weite write. I can't write anything. i am mentally singing the lyrics to this song and that is the only thing in my mind. I am going to try to go to the libraby tomm and study. I have parties to go to tonite and sat nite and an honors 'party' on sunday so I have to try to get as much done on sat. I feel like I am behind. college is hard as to where u will get behind and then wham it all sneaks up on u and u don't even realize it. but I love it so far and I can t imagine living this life for 4 years. thats a long time and I can see why people love these 4 years so much they are so random and fun. I can already tell that I am going to miss it during the summer and when I leave. I have 2 minutes left. I like having my own computer here I brought it over labor day weekend and I set it up, boucht the cables, etc all by myself which I have never doen before but I did it and its a cool sense of accomplishemnt. and I catually got the wthernet working even tho I had heard horror stories about it not working. its so fast. I like being self sufficient I thik its really good. I liked setting it up and makin it work myself. and it aint no I-Mac either where u just plug that mess in. oops times up. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='I remember when asked to do this assignment, I was wondering if someone would actually really want to know my thoughts. I find it kind of hard to just type out all of my thoughts, considering that there are hundreds of random thoughts every minute(or it seems). Phones ringing. cell phones. yuck. Interruptions. I knew that would happen. I don\\'t think I\\'m capable of having twenty minutes of silence to type something. All I know is that I am really really hot which will probably affect my thinking. I\\'m naturally a \"hot natured\" person, and my sister\\'s room is really hot. So hot I\\'m sitting here sweating and I\\'m barely moving my body. My room is just as hot though. I\\'m just hot all the time. I wonder what affects it really does have on me. I know it makes me grumpy sometimes. Especially if I\\'m hungry at the same time. That\\'s just a bad position to be in hot, sweaty, and hungry. No matter how low I turn are air conditioner, I\\'m still burning hot. Not to mention our electricity bill that makes me just as hot! But I guess I don\\'t have any room to complain. I couldn\\'t ask for anything more in my life. I have everything I\\'ve ever wanted and more! I accidentally meet my boyfriend and he just makes everything even better than it was. He makes me see things that I would have never seen before. He really has made a difference in my life. Thank you, thank you, thank you God. I wonder how my mom is feeling? Her surgery was last week, so I\\'m sure she doesn\\'t feel as bad as she did. Since she was at work a couple days later, I guess she must not have felt too bad. But she is a strong woman the strongest woman I\\'ve ever known. I\\'m proud to say that. Very proud. I guess you kind of\\' start missing your parents when you leave for college and you\\'re far from home. But I am lucky to have an older sister(who I live with) and I\\'ve always gotten to follow behind her, making her do everything first. That\\'s made my life a heck of a lot easier. I do miss my bed and my dogs. Not to mention my home. But I\\'ll be going home soon, so I\\'m ready to go. I\\'m ready to introduce my boyfriend to my parents and grandmother too. That should be fun! I know it will go well though. I also wonder if my sister\\'s car will be out of the shop, because I wanted to leave earlier than my sister. She won\\'t get out of class until 4pm and I was wanting to leave around noon. It just takes so long to get there. Grant wanted to ride with my dad when he goes on duty too. I guess I\\'ll leave around noon anyway and not go into work. Ohwell. I\\'m broke as it is. Why not add to that?!? A couple hours of missed work won\\'t hurt to badly. I do need the money though. I\\'m going to be eating well that weekend anyway. I\\'ll have 2 meals a day! That\\'s more than I can say now and the food I\\'ll get there is a million times better then what I would have here. You really start to miss the little things about life sometimes it just takes leaving your home for a couple months to do that to you. Years. it\\'s going to\\' be hard to be away for that long. But I guess it kind of grows on you after a while and you just don\\'t realize or notice it. Hmm I wonder how long I\\'ve been typing. I have a lot to read. '),\n",

I waiting for a phone call from my boyfriend he was supposed to call around 9:45 but he has not called yet and its starting to irritate me I also notice that I have only been typing for like 2 minutes. I wonder what I'm going to be typing for 18 more minutes. gosh I have some much to do tonight I have to starch my army uniform and polish my boots and I have to finish retyping my rhetorical analysis paper that didn't get saved for some reason and then I have to do some biology reading and finsih some biology questions. I don't really like my biology class but I do like my chemistry class but that probably just because its easy and I've done well in it so far. my ear is starting to hurt . I hope I don't have an ear infection. I feel like I'm starting to get a headache maybe its because I'm tired or maybe because I'm hungry . or maybe because I'm dehydrated. I dunno but once this is over I think I'm going to take some advil and hopefully that will make it feel better this is hard forcing myself to write what I'm thinking of . I've been looking at a computer screen most of the day and my eyes are starting to hurt maybe that is why I have a headache . who knows . but I can't wait till I get to  go to sleep . so do you guys actually read these I bet these can get really interesting I mean if I had to read over 500 of these I'd probably be pretty bored. but maybe pysch guys just like reading random thoughts, hundreds of them . is it stimulating?  I'm dating a guy who a psych. major . he is in grad school right now . mastering in something pysch related . he is supposed to call me right now . maybe he got held up reading random stream of conscious stuff . my jaw is aching right now too . I have tmj and it sucks my jaw is out of alignment and it hurts really bad. I wish I could just pop it back in place but that would be all sorts of hard and probably fairly painful . but anyways and its only been like 12 minutes . this is crazy . after this I have to do some real writing that does not rock my world because I know that I'll be tired and I won't feel like doing it an then I'll tell myself that I'll sleep for like an hour and then wake up and finish what I need to do but it won't happen . gosh I'm so freaking tired and my ears are really starting to hurt but I think it might be from my jaw and that probably why I have a headache . gosh I really could go for a massage right about now but I don't want to spend any of my money . my boyfriend gives really good massages and he is supposed to call me but he has not called me yet . what a dick. ugh how much longer of this seriously twenty minutes . I doubt that this writing assignment, aside from a simple grade, really benefits me in anyway . so is this an assignment so you psych guys can have experiments and such? crazy so we pay money to take a class so we can do assignments for psych guys who use them as experiments . hmmm I don't know if I like that idea . but oh well because this assignment is a lot better than the next one that I will have to do . but this is making me so tired and my eyes are really starting to have a hard time focusing on the computer and then when I close them I want to keep them shut and just sleep for like a few seconds and then a few seconds more oh well I only have like a minute left count down . 59 58 57 56 55 54 53 52 51 5049484746454443424140393837363534333231302928272625242 ah nice its over  \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"I enjoy my life so much right now, but I am also at a really tuff time in my life right now. I love Austin and UT, but my boyfriend lives back home. Things are great between us, but it is so hard not being able to see him everyday. I miss the little things, like just being able to drive 5 minutes to go to his house, now it takes me over three hours to go to his house. I guess though that when I do get to see him, that the time we spend together is more valuable. I never realized how much we took for granted the fact that we used to live so close together. Now just to hear his voice costs money. I miss him so much. I have faith that things will work out between us, it is just going to be a long hard road through college. We have a lot of growing up to do though too. We both have a huge jealously problem, which is part of the reason we broke up the first time we were together. Whenever trusted each other enough to let the other one go out with their friends, so we were always together, and eventually I guess we just got bored of each other. I think the biggest mistake we ever made, was breaking up because a lot of things happened during the time we were broken up that puts strain on our relationship now. Although I have to thank my parents for sending me down to provisionals this summer, because when I left, Adam realized that if we did not work things out soon, we were never going to be together again, because I was not going to wait around for him. I love Adam so much, I thank God everyday that I met him. He has been my best friend for three years now, and I couldn't think of anyone that has helped me through as much stuff as he has. He has always been there for me, except for when we broke up, and he only left because it hurt him to be around me. Other than that Adam is the person that has helped me through the toughest times in my life. No matter what happened during the day, Adam can always make me feel better. He can make all my worries fade. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"I just got up about twenty minutes ago and really thought that I should finish this assignment, I felt kind of embarrased the other day when the entire class had done theirs' and I was still sitting around without twenty minutes to spare. I really am kind of overwhelmed by the class and university in general, not that I've told anyone because that's just not how I deal with my problems. I scheduled my classes so that I have these breaks in between that I could presumably use to study, but I instead retire to my dorm room to eat macaroni and watch a movie. I watch too many movies in the first place (I'm a theater major, so it's basically study), but I haven't placed any amount of time into actual studying for classes like biology that I know I have trouble with. Between that and the massive theater program, it's just a bit too much. Here I am, now the tiny fish in the pond when I've spend the last four years on top of the game as far as acting was concerned. It's just a different place, different circumstances, and I just don't know where I fit in yet. I understand that I have to learn the ropes and pay my dues and then eventually I'll be on top (best case scenario anyway). But what will I do if this really isn't the path best meant for me? I really, honestly don't think I'd be able to survive in a desk job for the rest of my working life, and if I don't make it as an actor, chances are, that's exactly what I'll have to do. That prospect terrifies me even more than the class thing, or I guess goes along with it, because to even have a chance at success in the entertainment industry I have to have a broad range of intelligences not only within the field, but general knowhow as well, so I'm back to the first worry. It just seems like it's never good enough, I went to junior high in Colorado where I was the smartest kid in the school, the guy everybody and their dog went to for the answer, I come to Texas and suddenly, I'm not the best anymore. Which was alright with me, it unloaded that pressure, blah, blah, but I lost my initiative to try harder than everybody else to get the grade. Since then, my identity has been kind of in the in-between realm, I have intelligence, I was in the top 10 percent of my class, but most of the actual retained knowledge I have from  high school is pop-culture trivia, but I think I could still hold my own on Jeopardy. That is something that made me feel better about college, about a week before I came here, they were showing the Jeopardy college championships, most participants hailing from the Ivy Leage, or whatever, and I just tore them apart, even in stuff like Chemistry which I had thought was long gone from my memory after sophomore year, who knew? So I guess I feel alright about classes in the end, maybe it's just because I feel so boring just hanging in my room all the time and don't really feel a part of the student body. I'm sure it'll happen sooner or later, but like most occurances in the history of man, it's over a girl. Long distance relationships are really hard, and here I am trying to pull one off in freshman year, it's going great so far, and I guess it says something that going out and partying runs a distant second to a five minute phone conversation with her, but it's just not helping me become a Longhorn. I love her to death, I really do, so I just haven't worried about it, I figured that it'd work itself out, and I think it still will. Adjustment is hard, especially such an immense one. Gah, college. I've started to believe that there's a soundtrack to life, I guess we'll probably cover that with the psych TA at some point in time, but seriously. Depending on what's going on in my life, I have certain predelections to what kinds of music, and specific songs I listen to, and I guess it's beyond obvious that it has some psychological base, but it's all the time now. I have Bruce Springsteen's   Secret Garden   running through my head right now, most likely because I just started thinking about my girlfriend a while back, which made me think of the times we've spent together, and for some reason bringing about the two of us sitting and watching Jerry Maguire and remembering Springsteen from the soundtrack and noticing the correlation of the lyrics with my feelings for this girl. It probably wasn't very smart to have done this this morning, I don't feel like my thoughts are in order. It's the morning of September 11th, I just realized. I'm not worried though, I have faith in this country, I have faith in my own ideals of freedom and life and soforth. Bring em on. If they attack again, I really don't think we can stop them, and it'll suck having more American lives lost, but they can't tear down who we are. There's my bit of patriotism, just thought it appropriate given the day, but my twenty minutes are up, so I'm damming the stream. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='William Golding뗩 novel The Lord of the Flies explores many themes such as the dark side of human nature, allegiances, and how these boys mirror larger society. I feel as if the producers of the popular television show Sur- vivor used this novel as the framework of their show. Both Golding뗩 novel and the show have many similarities.When the show Survivor premiered, I immediately thought of the novel The Lord of the Flies. The novel is about a group of schoolboys who are ship- wrecked on a deserted island. The boys attempt to create a 띾ivilization, but147  ultimately transform into mere savages. This is an important novel for the psychological study Golding presents. One can뗪 help but draw parallels to adult society. There is a true need for structure and control in any society, but the means of that control makes this novel all the more interesting.One of the boys, Jack, is power-hungry and represents dictatorship. Some of the other boys such as Simon and Piggy try to do what is safe and conservative. The character of Ralph is symbolic of democracy and fairness. Throughout the novel, the boys engage in a power struggle and end up destroying one another. Golding뗩 use of symbolism forces the reader to see characters and situations as larger ideas. The boys realize that they must create some type of order.Similar to the television show Survivor, the boys hold council meet- ings, use objects as a symbol of strength, and use 遼re as a symbol of hope. I remember watching the show and observing a contestant who won a phys- ical contest against the other players. This person was given a pillow to use, whereas the other contestants had nothing. The pillow symbolizes power, as did the conch in the novel. Also, whenever the show뗩 council met on Sunday nights, they all brought their torches. When someone was voted off the island (seen as a liability or risk to the welfare of the group), that per- son뗩 torch was extinguished, thus eliminating hope. Alliances were formed and these alliances pitted the contestants against each other. Ultimately the winner was the most cunning player who could convince the other mem- bers to follow them. This is exactly the situation that occurred between Ralph and Jack in the novel.William Golding뗩 novel allows the reader to explore human nature and mankind. Often, we do not like to face the psychological aspects of our being. Survivor emulates the same underlying motives that form our nature.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"     I just got done doing some homework for critical thinking and it is really late. I am extremely tired and I wish I would have done this assignment earlier. This is hard to write when I am so tired. I should have not talked on the phone all night and done my work earlier, but I was such a good conversation. Its funny how I always want to type about just nothing and now I can but it feels weird. Anyway my conversation was about me going home this weekend. I am going home because my uncle and his wife are down from North Carolina and my mom wants me to visit. I wonder how my cousins (my uncle that's downs kids) are doing. One is my age and the other is two years older then me. They both go to college but I'm not sure where. I also have cousins that go to Texas State. the other day I was thinking about calling one of them to see if she wanted to hang out since we are so close. but I don't have her number. I actually havent even talked to her in a year almost. The last time I saw her was last thanksgiving. We always eat thanksgiving dinner and my great aunts house. Thinking about Thanksgiving is making me hungry for some green bean casarole. My mom always makes that for Thanksgiving. Its the best! So is fried okra. I had that for dinner last night with some mashed potatoes at the Jester City Limits. Jester City Limits has some good food but its very tiring and makes me feel like I eat to much, they should close earlier so I can't eat so much. Running is very good. I actually found the energy to go run today. In high school I played soccer so I was in really good shape and ran a whole lot. NOw I don't run at all and I need to. Hopefully I can keep the routine of running all the time. I was suppose to fun with my next door neighboor today but she went later. Its funny I have lived her and she has been my neighbor for almost two weeks and yesterday was the first time I meet her. She is a really cool girl. We also meet two other girls from the same hallway. I like meeting people. I also meet a guy and me, him, and steph went to HEB how strange is that? then we went to go eat ice cream. It was really good, really expensive, and really sweet. The girl Steph works at an ice cream/ coffee shop that is hiring now. I intend on putting in an application there soon. Jobs are good, because you get money and I need lots of money so I can pay for my traffic ticket. I speed everywhere and I get a ticket for running a red light. how weird. Yesterday my friend Ryan ran one too in front of a cop and he didn't get stopped. o the luck I have. I actually shouldn't complain about my luck, I know people with way worse luck then myself. my little sisters friend megan has really bad luck. Her dad died the other day. It was really sad I wonder if she is doing any better? probably. I wonder what the  little sister is doing right now anyway. I think she has a volleyball game tommorrow. She is so cute she plays soccer just because I played. I like how she looks up to me. I wish I would have had a really old sister to look up to. The closest thing to that where my cousins, who know live in alaska and montana. Alaska would be a very crazy place to live. I'm not sure I would want to live there even though my grandma says it was vvery very beautiful. I am going to visit the old grandparents very soon. I am flying there in two weekends. I love flying, I have always dreamed of becoming a flight attendent one day. I think that would be so fun to get to fly anywhere you want whenever for free. I have always wanted to travel to different places and that would be the perfect oppurtunity. I think I just spelt that word wrong. o well I don't want to fix it. So I see that this writing assignment is almost done. that was the fastest 20 minuetes that have ever passed by I really want to go to sleep. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Right now i am simply writing and not feeling anything in particular. I am somewhat upset right now though because my throat is hurting, and this is due to the fact that i have started smoking a lot more than usual. I am a pretty sensitive person so i think that is why it hurts. who knows. I also am feeling a little unmotivated at the moment and i can't figure out why. This is the time in life when i am supposed to be super juiced to go out and get what i want, to grab life by the horns so to speak. This is not happening though, and it is kind of scary. Throughout my life i have been pretty much handed everything i have either through the mediocrity of others or through my own natural abilities, or a combination of both. It scares me to think that i have never applied myself fully to anything that i have ever done, and have still managed a somewhat successful, although underachieving, life. It makes me wonder a few things though about myself and what i have in store for the rest of my life. I don't know if i actually know how to apply myself fully to something, and if i do will i actually be able to stop and apply it to something else. This not only applies to me with work and school but also with personal relationships. Up to this point I have many friends, but very few whom i can actually call close friends. They are just there because of attrition or because i was what some people might call popular in high school. I wasn't popular because of my stunning personality though, but more of what i was;  a basketball player, an intelligent person, and somewhat goodlooking. When i got to college and found that there are hundreds if not thousands of people like this i found out that i am not at all who i thought. I don't really know who i am and who im not, and i am kind of scared to try to find out. When i finally decide what i am will i like it?  Will anyone else like me?  Will it make me happy or will i learn to hate myself because i disdain the person that i actually am. They say that you can be whoever you want but this is not true. You can TRY to be whoever you want but for some reason you cannot always be this way because there is something deep down inside of you that knows better. If i try to be a suave cool underpressure type guy, but fall down a lot, it doesn't really fit. I can want to be that way so badly, but it may never come true. If I accept that fact that i am a goofy dork will I like what that will get me. I am going out on a limb here and saying that women aren't exactly falling all over themselves for goofy dorks. At least not ones that i have met just yet. Perhaps this is just society pulling on me, and i should just accept whatever i am. The true question how do you find out who you are?  I want to know so bad that it hurts, but there is not equation to find out. You just have to go out there and do it, and I am too scared to do it. I don't want to end up like the rest of my family, just sitting around waiting, feeling sorry for myself. I feel so much safer and better though when i just stay within myself and don't wander out of my comfort zone. My guess is when you do the wandering is when you find out who you really are. I don't see the oppurtunities yet. I am still waiting and wondering, hoping. I guess if i knew how to talk to people better than it would be easier to find out who i am. When i talk to people though its like they want to get away from me as fast as they can. They look down on me and they don't even know me. I don't understand why this is, but i am afraid that it is because of   who i am  . I think i am doomed to always be this way, and it scares me. I don't want to  be this way. I am too needy for random people to want to be my acquantance, friend, what have you. I expect too much too fast and it scares people fast. People accepted it in the past because they   wanted   to be my friend because of who i was, but alas now that is not the case. So now im stuck, clutching onto the past like a has been with no real hope of ever stretching out and completing myself. Then i will be like the rest \"),\n",

       " Document(page_content='    I feel as if my life revolves around a world full of unanswerable questions. I cannot seem to find what it is that I want out of life. There are so many options and turns where I can easily decide to follow, but I am so inconsistent of what I truly feel passionate about. I wake up in the morning and step outside of my dormitory daily smelling the fresh air. Everyday it seems as if there is something I have not witnessed before. I need answers to my life. I am a person that does not go through the day easily without understanding why things are the way they are. I am a first year student at the University of Texas and I have been bombarded with hundreds of organizations and choices that will lead me somewhere in the next few years. Not only academically has this burden faced me straight on, but I am confused about a girl I have met as well. As with the hundreds of organizations, there are hundreds of girls I see in and out of my classes. Do I really want a relationship so soon? And further, can I handle a girl that is apart of the Greek system knowing that I will never have a desire in joining one in the future? It is so hard to choose a path when you analyze your choices to death. For instance, if I decide to discontinue dating this wonderful girl just because I will not be able to tolerate her constant consumption of alcohol and nightly partying with other fraternity guys, will this decision have been the most appropriate one? Or is it possible I may be a bit too judgemental of her capabilities of being a loyal girlfriend? In addition to my social life, I have to maintain some arbitrary schedule which will be beneficial for my personal needs. Like many others, I have been set loose from the world I used to know and I am on a path where I control my line of travel. It is realistic yet frightening at the same time. All my life, choices have been easy. And if I was faced with an extenuating circumstance then I always had the parental feedback to support my decision. I am creating a life. It is not just any life; it is mine. I am on my own. I have waited for this moment for a long time. And now, I do not know what to do with it. Is this normal? Have I overlooked something? Is it humanely possible to beg and plead for an entity such as freedom and once it has been acquired to not desire its power as much? I am eager for the future and ecstatic for what is yet to come. I hope I am joining the right organizations that appeal to me. I also hope I will stay academically strong as I was in high school. And further, I hope I will have made the right choice with the girl I met. I have faith that I will be led in the right direction. '),\n",
       " Document(page_content='So here are twenty minutes of Brian\\'s thoughts. As I sit here, I am dumbfounded by the ignorance of humans. Today I talked to a coworker about religion. He found out that I\\'m agnostic and proceeded to proselytize. I can respect this, because his religion dictates that people who don\\'t accept Jesus Christ will go to hell. But at the same time, I poked several holes in the Christian philosophy and in the Bible. He wasn\\'t able to counter my arguments, and he responded only by saying that he has faith. This epitomizes human ignorance. I have faith the chair I\\'m sitting in now will not collapse and harm me. This faith is based on my past experiences with chairs and with seeing things that turn out to, in fact, exist. Yet he claims he has \"faith\" in a god that nobody on this planet can prove they\\'ve seen. I can just as well assert via faith that there is a Pink Elephant on the other side of the moon that we\\'ll never see. I\\'ve never seen this elephant, but I KNOW it\\'s there. I have faith. It speaks to me through the Elephant Spirit. What the fuck is that all about? How can someone bastardize his or her beliefs to knowledge like this?? It is incomprehensible to me. I realize that people have a deepseated need for absolutes. Nobody wants to think our planet is a lonely hunk of dirt floating in space, so instead we conjure up deities that give our lives and our very existence meaning. Never mind that there is absolutely no reason to believe we are correct save a book compiled thousands of years ago based on events hundred or thousands of years before that! Who needs logic and reason anyway? And it never ceases to amaze me that some scientists still embrace religion! It scares me how easy it is for them to walk away from work and into church and never mingle the two because they\\'re so incompatible. It makes me truly sad that people can be so stupid. Thankfully our society is progressing further and further away from religion, albeit at a crawling pace. And even so, rather than shedding this relic of our intellectual infancy we simply mold the religion (absolute truth, mind you) to fit our current society and way of life. I\\'m dumbfounded. It also amazes me how closedminded people can be. I\\'m gay. Big deal. Yet many people (though a few proportion in Austin) perceive me as evil for it. My actions are vile and disgusting to them. Never mind the fact that homosexual activity occurs in nature, though not as frequently as heterosexual behavior. And don\\'t even touch upon the fact that there is no logical, reasonable justification for opposing homosexuality. People have all these notions that homosexuals are pedophiles or that we try to \"recruit. \" At the risk of sounding pessimistic in my writing and thoughts, I can\\'t believe how moronic our society is, on average. We even have Al Gore in the news saying he opposes samesex marriage based on religious reasons. (Hmm, are my two pet peeves of the day related? Of course!) J. And so I\\'m left sitting here, wondering how people can be so stupid as to embrace Christianity and oppose homosexuality. Ugh. THESE are the times that try men\\'s (and women\\'s) souls! Which brings up another point. I\\'m so annoyed at how misogynistic our society is. The craze in the past decade has been political correctness, and conservatives are sick of it. But things haven\\'t changed nearly as much as people think. I still sit through lectures where the professor refers to every character described (a banker, an investor, a CEO) as he. he. he. I can\\'t stand it. But perhaps it\\'s not so much that these professors are bigoted to some degree. Perhaps they\\'re simply trying to convey the way the world really is! Because women don\\'t have anywhere near an equitable stake in society. In finance we were shown some subcommittees of the boards of directors of Procter and Gamble and Home Depot, Inc. Out of some two dozen positions between the two companies ONE PERSON was a woman! I can\\'t stand it. I feel like I\\'m a bastion of fairness and equity and reason in a sea of stupid people! (Keep in mind, I\\'m not this pessimistic in my day to day activities, perhaps just in my mind. Hehe. ) And, not that I\\'m trying necessarily to relate it to our class, this is all psychology! It\\'s probably evolutionary psychology more than anything. With regard to religion, as survival machines for our genes, we\\'d like to believe we will continue indefinitely. This manifests itself in various religions that promise us eternal life. And we\\'d like to believe that our existence isn\\'t arbitrary, so we conjure up a god who gives us meaning, ignoring the myriad moral and logical problems this presents. With homosexuality. gay people don\\'t reproduce if they fully express their sexuality. Of course not all do, which is why homosexuality could persist in the population as long as it has. And so on some level I\\'m sure we\\'re afraid that if we accept homosexuality, more people will \"choose\" to be homosexual. Then the species will die out! Oh no! (I know per Richard Dawkins that evolutionary psychology operates on a genetic level, not a societal level, but you see my point. ) Anyway, I suppose that\\'s my time for this week. Tune in again next week for more ramblings from Brian\\'s ultraliberal mind. '),\n",

Does ben really think his life is so much more important than mine or more difficult because he is going to med school. His life  could be a lot more rough! Aah, what was I thinking he's not really even my type I don't have time for another boyfriend/heartbreak! How could he sit there and tell me I am the perfect woman for him but just not right now!

Laundry, homework, visit with Sarah, suck up to my Dad and if that's not enough we had to add being sick and on my period to the list! Like I don't have enough to deal with. I wonder If Annie is ever going to quit smoking, you think that the prospect of having children would be enough to make her quit but it's not. I wonder why thats the case. HOw can smoking be that addictive that it can stop you from bringing another human llife in to the world? I wonder why she started smoking in the first place. It will be cool when she has kids of her own to see what they turn out to be like? I wonder if I'll be there cool Aunt Rebecca, I kind of like the sound of that!

I wrote this once before and my computer crashed it is no longer working and I was bout to pick it up and throw it out the window. This means that I really need a laptop or any new computer. I really want a laptop. Actually I would be content with a computer that will not shut down, freeze up and otherwise suck every 10 minutes. I am happy to be at ut this year. I am glad that I get to be near my girlfriend, we lived 4 hours apart last year, and its nice to see her everyday. I am on her computer right now, and it's too early to be doing this. I can't function. The past 2 days I was working my ass off to get this paper written for my freshman seminar and I got like 6 hours of sleep in those 2 days. That would have been fine if I got 3 each day, but I got one hour the first night, and five the next. Five isn't enough to overcome 1, and then last night after my extreme frustration with my computer not cooperating I went to sleep around 1:30 and then woke up at 9. That's still not enough. I need to get like 12 hours of sleep tonight; I would feel so much better. Well I am getting really bored doing this but I am keeping to the instructions, which for some unknown reason, were repeated over 13 times on the website. I mean I get the idea, I write what I think. You do not need to tell it to me, changing the order of the subject/object 13 times. Believe it or not saying the same thing, using the same words, but in a different order is not the same thing as explaining squat. I'm no expert, nor am I writer really. Actually my writing stinks. But I guess I expected more. College is a lot different from high school, but it certainly has its similarities. For example, my professor in my calc class is a really nice guy, but speaks very little English and has a heavy accent. Kids try and run over him, and it pisses me off. There enough problems with understanding him without him having to deal with people who refuse to listen to him. He knows his math and all. But still Anyway I am bored doing assignment, especially because I have don't it once before. OK I'm about to pass out. Someone needs to wake me up or something. Why can't I stay awake? Oh well im. I am a very slow typist. I wish I could type faster. But I am now finished with the minimum of 20 minutes and I will proceed to turn this in.

       " Document(page_content='So I\\x92m sitting here typing about whatever is on my mind. Well, a whole lot is on my mind right now, like what the hell am I supposed to do about my car. Good Lord, that\\'s all I needed, my care to really mess up on me. But anyway, right now, I\\x92m really missing my girlfriend. She is all that consumes my thoughts, so a random progression of my subconscious thoughts will most likely be all about her. I really know how much she means to me now that I went back home to see her. Enough about Liz. Thinking consciously about her will just make me very sad. I was thinking about acid the other day, you know, LSD. I was told that Lewis Carroll, author of \"Alice in Wonderland\", was having one hell of a trip when he wrote the book. That would explain some of the messed up things that he wrote about, but I think that if he had tapped into his own subconscious, he would have been able to write about the same stuff. I mean, LSD allows you to see things that you normally would not see on your own, but I think that deep within your own consciousness, that is what you would really see. For example, I have a friend that said that the ceiling looked like it was dripping, due to all of the little bumps on it from paint. If you look at a ceiling like that long enough, with a clear head, I believe that you would see the exact same thing. I guess that the only reason this kind of pisses me off is that there are so many people that believe that really messed up art, music, and literature can only be created by some one who is having one really wicked trip or who is on some drug or stimulant of some kind. That is complete BS because when I write, or draw, or create music that\\'s really screwed up, I tend to always do it in a clear frame of mind. It really makes me mad that some people believe art comes from being fucked up when all the time it comes from the heart (where it should come from) or the inner recesses of  one\\'s mind. I don\\'t want people to think that all the art I create comes from drug abuse when it really comes from my own tormented mind. The absence of the love of your life can lead to some really messed up art. I\\'ve written some of the most depressing work I\\x92ve ever written lately because of that absence. If it were humanly possible, financially etc. , I would marry that girl in a heartbeat because I think the only way for me to be completely happy is to be with her. The drumming in my head is beginning to start. How quaint for the artistic flow to arrive just as I am planning to leave the site. The drumming will continue the rest of my evening. '),\n",
       " Document(page_content='A single overweight person might not warrant much attention. But a nation whose population is increasingly obese is cause for concern. In the United States, 14% of children and teenagers are categorized as overweight. Why is this a serious problem instead of simply a matter of personal choice? What are the causes of this constantly increasing percentage of obese per-61  sons? What is to be done about this, and what organized steps should be taken to solve the problem?Just as there are ripples from a stone thrown into the water, there are far- reaching and unending effects resulting from obesity. From a psychologi- cal perspective, most obese persons would prefer not to be overweight. Our society glori遼es the ultra-thin, so if you are obese you do not 遼t in with acceptable modes of appearance. We know that children are often cruel about taunting their heavy classmates. All too often we hear friends say, I뗬e got to lose weight before that trip, or 락efore the wedding. How- ever, there are more objective measures of the negative results of obesity. Type 2 (adult onset) diabetes, an illness with serious consequences, includ- ing damage to the heart, damage to the eyes and dif遼culty in healing infec- tions is attributed to obesity. Public health agencies are dealing with the continual rise in this type of diabetes. Asthma is also on the rise as a result of the obesity epidemic as are sleep disorders such as sleep apnea. Recent research indicates a relationship between some types of cancer and obesity. Society pays the price when citizens are ill, are unable to work, and require constant medical care.Questions arise: What can be done about this? Who or what is to blame? Discussing blame is a delicate problem. There are undoubtedly overweight individuals with inherited tendencies toward diabetes or heart disease, and there is evidence that a hormone that gives people a sense of fullness after eating may be lacking in some obese people. Yet, knowing that they are at risk would suggest that steps be taken to thwart the onset of the physical consequences of obesity.Most authorities agree that diet is key. The avoidance of foods high in sugars, carbohydrates, and saturated fats is recommended by most physi- cians as a way to ward off obesity and its dire consequences. But this is dif- 遼cult in our society where fast food outlets are ubiquitous, where we are bombarded by advertising of unhealthy foods, and where we lead increas- ingly sedentary lives. Sugar-laden soft drinks are sold in schools and prof- its from these sales are high. An elementary school in Los Angeles received$50,000 for allowing Coca-Cola to install its vending machines. This com- pany and Pepsico constitute the majority of the school soft drink market, and while they pro遼t from the present sales, they are also building brand loyalty and creating future habitual soft drink consumers.Lack of adequate exercise is a concomitant contributor to the rise in obe- sity. Children are often playing video games instead of engaging in sports. Adults watch television instead of exercising. People will drive around62  shopping centers to avoid walking a few extra steps. The quintessential 띾ouch potato invention has just been invented. Now you can get a uni- versal remote with which, from your comfortable couch, you can not only control your television, but your oven, lights and, presumably, other things which we can only begin to imagine.Society suffers when its population is increasingly unhealthy, has rising medical costs, notes absenteeism from work and school, and has social inequalities. This latter result, social inequalities, re遼ects the assertion recently made by a school administrator that 50% of children in poorer school districts are obese. Experts seem to believe that obesity is a problem that can, with diligence and desire, be eliminated or at least mitigated with two simple changes in lifestyle단ating more healthily and getting more exercise.'),\n",

The only thing that is keeping me afloat is the loan money I got for the semester. It's a lot of money but I want to save little What the hell am I supposed to do when I need to go to WalMart to get some Hotpockets or some bottled water The water here in Austin is so nasty. That is definitely one thing that I miss about home is the good well water we had I was so good Twenty minutes has to be coming up soon. oh look, hey there all done, (a rush of happiness) and now I am thinking all of these unholy thoughts that I don't have to type Goodbye  \"),\n",

Man it just seems like all he ever does is play on his stupid computer and he's getting mean now. He was really mean when I asked him about the fire drill the other day because he's probably fake like that like Paul Gosh Paul annoys the crap out of me I hope he doesn't come to UT because that would just be horrible. But knowing my luck he's going to come to UT and that would just be great Kenny's a pretty good roommate but I think he might be getting annoyed with me or something because I sleep later than he does and I think I talk more than he does something is wrong with him too because he never talks now I look at him differently for some strange reason and I want to be a bad kid again rather than the 'good' Christian boy I used to be I want a tattoo and I want some piercings hmmm that would be cool and my classes are okay but I have this guilty feeing and I don't know why I don't know if my friends here are true or not, maybe it's better if I just keep to myself more because I have this bad feeling that I haven't really met someone that's truly there you know I mean Debra is nice and all but still I think she might be fake and Sing just uses me he looks like a damn alien it's so gross ahhh I have to wash my face in a few seconds after I'm done with this because I think I'm getting acne again and that would just be horrible I though asians weren't supposed to get acne.

       " Document(page_content='It is weird to be here because usually people are here and I could visit them but no one is at home. My brother is now doing all the stuff I did last year and it\\'s kind of a weird role reversal. I am also frustrated because I am here and if it was normal circumstances Jared would be here but of course his family decided to take a vacation and they are out of town. and it\\'s so weird and frustrating to be here and not be able to just call him and see him, I guess it is part of the annoying \"sensitivity\" that girls seem to employ. I need to get out of that habit. But, in an hour and a half or so, I will be driving back to UT and bringing my roommate\\'s and also my friends from here. The whole situation did not work out exactly how we planned because I was going to stay here this whole weekend but then Jill\\'s ride got all messed up so if I don\\'t bring her up today I have Chris and Emily who will be very disappointed and I would feel guilty if I just stayed here instead. but actually I kind of just do want to stay here at home for awhile and actually get some stuff done and just relax but I also am torn the other way too. Whatever, my mind is so strange sometimes. and also I am feeling stupid writing all these thoughts down. Am I going to be diagnosed with some kind of disorder by what I\\'ve written? rhetorical question. computers can be very frustrating. It is really getting on my nerves that I am not allowed to complete my pretesting requirement on here. at first I couldn\\'t even access the screen to type in my social security number and then when I could do that it won\\'t accept my password or user name. That is all very frustrating and I\\'ve tried all these different computers trying to access it. Oh well. Hopefully, I will finally figure it out. As I just skimmed over what I\\'ve written thus far, I am worried. The blurb above says there is no right or wrong thing to say but I have before, just done completely the opposite of what was intended on an assignment and I had to redo it so this makes me slightly nervous as to if the content of this is adequate or not. It is very quiet in this area right now and my thoughts seem so loud in comparison since they are all that I can \"hear\" and it all the activity that is going on. This assignment is actually kind of ironic because usually, I do write down everything that is in my head, like my thoughts and my feelings, and it helps me sort things out. It usually angers my friends because then they never know what upset me before because I wouldn\\'t say anything because I\\'d have to go write it down to figure it out. Yet, while I\\'m typing this, it seems so forced to have to write down my thoughts. I guess because the \"audience\" I am typing for is so unknown and I feel self conscious of what I write. I just thought about this calculus homework I\\'ve been trying to work on for the past hour or so. It is so aggravating to try and understand something and completely fail or only understand a little bit which does nothing for progress toward solving the problem. I guess that is something I miss. I miss my smaller classes where there was always a lot of discussion and interaction. I guess in a way I\\'m being selfish but I can\\'t help feeling that way. Oh well, I guess I am still in transition but I\\'m used to everything I just am not sure how much I like everything. well, I guess that is all my thoughts for now. I am so random sometimes. My train of thought that leads me to some comment or question is sometimes so mixed up and completely out of nowhere that I can\\'t even believe how I think of some things. I\\'m not sure. But I bet a psychologist somewhere could figure that dilemma out. : ) '),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"     I was thinking about college and all the stuff that comes with it. college will be so hard yet so easy, i wonder how i will control myself. i don't want the fun factor to totally overrule the work factor. but then again, the classes seem pretty fun and not so hard. yet again, it has also only been a week of classes, so i could be sorely mistaken. we will just have to see what happens as time unfolds. i'm also a little worried because i have a boyfriend that goes to stephen f. austin state university, and driving distance that is 3 and 1/2 hours away!! how will i manage this?? we have been together for over a year and a half, so i can't just throw the relationship away, he means a lot to me. what do i do?? i guess i will give it time and see what happens. college is a lot to handle, and managing it all with a long-distance boyfriend is not easy. i don't know what i'm getting myself into. i'm also really pissed that i decided to stay at dobie, because after visiting friends in towers today i realized how much better it is, and what i rip off dobie is. the food sucks!! it drives me insane how bad it is and what a rip off everything is. towers is way better. i'm just glad that i'm rooming with my great friend shara in a badass apartment next year. yay!! we'll have our own rooms and all we'll have to do is take a short bus trip to campus every day. not that bad. plus we'll be more familiar with campus and won't get so lost, as i do here constantly. but it is my first year after all, so it can't be that bad. i'm also kind of nervous about my freshman seminar class, it sounds so ridiculously hard! a lot of writing and sharing your   feelings,   and all that stuff. i had to read like 15 pages just on how to   listen   correctly to other people. i'm 18 years old! i know how to listen! this is not kindergarten. it just makes me so mad. i'm really glad i met my friend shara, i knew her slightly my senior year in high school so we come from the same background and have a lot to relate to. i've gotten to know her so well these past 2 weeks that i feel like i've known her all my life! she's such a great girl. i like how she does not hesitate to compliment her friends for ANYTHING. great character trait to have. and i'm glad about all the parties that are here in austin, and the unique culture. walking around even with a friend at night is a little scary though, but i'll never walk by myself anyway so it's all good. and i love the music scene. i'm afraid i'll go too shopping-crazy though because urban outfitters is so readily available down the street and back home in houston it was like miles away towards downtown. i'm obsessed with spongebob! i have three spongebob squarepants posters on my wall in my dorm room, and i have spongebob band-aids. he's so cute! and the show is hilarious, totally my type of humor. i have the dvd as well, is that scary or what?? and you know what makes me mad? i got a heat rash here a few days after i moved in! that sucks! why here of all places? i think houston is MUCH hotter just because of the huge humidity factor. but NO i get a heat rash here. sucks. at least it's not visible, it's only little bumps you can barely feel. AND i got a popped blood vessel in MY EYE. what more could possibly go wrong? i guess a lot but it's so much to handle right when i get there! makes me so self conscious! i guess that's a psychology topic--why people get self-conscious. interesting topic. i would like to talk about it sometime in class. i think when i'm done with this i will do some physics problems and then just watch zoolander on dvd or something. yay. i'm so glad i have a tv, vcr, and dvd player! my room is totally pimped out, how great is that. i feel so exhausted. walking isn't easy in this heat, no matter what time of the day it is. i'm actually getting really hungry. i might fix myself a peanut butter sandwich. crunchy, but of course, what else? crunchy is the way to go. should i feel guilty about making plans to go to a party on a thursday night? is that bad? i don't really think so, seeing as on fridays i have only one 1 hour class from 12-1. wow that was a lot of 1s. god i'm so hungry, is this thing over yet? my hands are shaking. need food. aagh. peanut. butter. crunchy. does it matter if i'm coherent or not? it's just that when i get hungry, WHAM it hits me like a train and i get all hungry and can't help it. oh well. i hope this thing was entertaining for you, or whoever is reading this thing. i'm glad i got this over with early. yay im done. \"),\n",

I doubt they'll even read that much of it. Bita talks a lot. She always has. That reminds me of Miss A. She never calls me. Why do I have to call everyone? Nobody ever calls me. Juliana emails a lot. I should e mail everyone. I'm much too busy for that. I need to call Dad. I want him to call me right now. At least that guy fixed the Internet. I need to learn to type. Okay I think I can stop now.

I warned him though. I knew the second I met her that she was up to no good. She came between two best friends and she didn\\'t even care. I wonder how my friends at schools far away are doing.

She is so much fun. I guess I\\'ll see her on OU weekend. Then I can tell her all about my trip to New York. Kelli will be home from Georgia, too. I can\\'t wait to see her either.

We really confessed a lot to each other, It was good to get some of those things off of my chest. The situation is pretty good right now, I hope Rob doesn\\'t make the situation worse--if he is a real friend he will encourage Andy like he said he would. I think my friend Dallas in Arizona is miserable. He has never really been his own person-- he relies too much on other people for his identity and now he knows no one a t school, He will really grow from this experience though. I should call him, but then again ===That phone bill! That (the save in $) is the good thing about Email. I can always send him regular mail, too. I like real mail. You can write your true feelings so much easier in a letter. That is why I like to write Andy, '),\n",

When you turn the sound down, not all commercials are as selfexplanatory as you might think. I needed to know that. I want to go somewhere. I need to drive. I just don't know how to get anywhere.

Could probably just run to the 7-11, then I could get a slurpee. This chair is still uncomfortable, even with this cushion.

I really should throw that bottle of water away, it's probably getting kind of funky. I'm going to fill this whole thing up in like 10 minutes, then what?  I want concert tickets, that was stupid waiting and then they sold out. I don't really want to pay a fortune, maybe 50. Doubt I could get them that cheap. I'm surprised Jenna hasn't charged over here yet, the morning's been really quiet. I've got so many things to do, none of which I probably will. got to write those thank you notes, if grandparents keep sending me cash I never will have to go to the bank, good deal. Oh, the screen moved up, maybe I won't fill the whole thing up. Ten minutes to go. My shoulder kind of hurts, must be sitting kind of funny. I wonder if I'll ever need those receipts, should probably just throw them away, see how much I can junk up my bullentin board, like I did my room. I could watch All My Children while I write my thank you notes, that sounds like a plan. I hope it's not a hayley and mateo day, don't think I could handle that. Got to love Lenny Kravitz. this song brings back memories of 7th, no 8th grade. I think I liked 8th grade, don't really remember. Back at good old H. m. s.

Maybe she'll be home for the balloon fest, doubt it. It's going to be so hot and miserable, at least I'm not dancing. Wonder who'll be taking my place, hope it's not chrissy.

I don't know all the words to everybody wants to rule the world, but that's the song on the radio right now. I can't recall ever hearing a song that I didn't like on KGSR. I think that I'll stay in Austin this summer so that I can continue to listen to it. I really missed it last summer, when I didn't really do anything. no, adi can't check his mail. he needs to get his own computer, but then again, so do I. so back to the point, there isn't one, Adi is not impressed with my psychology assignment. he wants to check his mail. that is why he is bitter. he won\\x92t leave me alone to concentrate on my stream of consciousness or however you spell it. Lyle is not a man. she is the only girl I've ever met named Lyle. Adi will not stop talking about her, I don\\x92t know what his fascination is with her, except that she is very attractive and other things. but that's all I have to say about her, because she is just my very nice friend. I honestly don't care, adi. I\\x92m not lying, I know exactly what my feelings are. adi needs to get the hell out of here. by the way, his real name is aditya, but Americans can't pronounce that. maybe he should go back to India. like tonight. I hate the commercials on KGSR though. which is why I keep a CD ready for the ten minute commercial times. red shirt Sara, as she's known, was talking about marriage today, I think. that's really scary, since she's only 18, and also because if she marries any one, it should be me. at least for a few days. and Karen hasn\\x92t been around much, but she's kind of out of it anyway. rosy cheeks. Jason has large speakers for his computer. which don't really have any meaning for me, since I never play computer games or do other things with them. I only check my email obsessively, although I usually don't ramble as much, unless I'm emailing my friend Tara, who I tell alot of useless information to. my stream of consciousness is rather boring, as I've learned in past jobs. I've had to entertain myself before while working long hours with no one else around at non engaging tasks. I usually sing whatever song is on my mind until I want to kill myself. (not really-which I should mention since you are psychologists)it's just that these songs get on my mind and won't go away, and all I can do is sing them over and over again. also I sometimes translate them into French. it always seems like I've accomplished something after I've done that. twenty minutes is a long time to just type. at least I have the radio on to give me some sort of stimulation, something to type about. adi has since left the room, which is why what I type is no longer influenced by the things (girls) he is talking about, or rather, about which he is talking. Its hard not to end your sentence with a preposition while typing a stream of consciousness thing, it's also difficult to spell consciousness correctly. I think I need to hear the new Sundays CD, it sounds really good, at least the one song that I've heard from it. I haven't bought a CD in a few weeks now, my last one being an older Poi Dog Pondering CD that I like a lot. my hands are beginning to hurt a little now. fortunately I only have two minutes left. I wonder how many people wrote about how much longer they had left. I know you can type longer, and I'd love to, except I have other homework and my hands hurt in addition to other excuses that I have available. so now I'm going to count to sixty, and that'll be twenty minutes. 60,549. 58,47. 56,55,54,53. that's getting old, although that really was what was going through my mind, only I couldn't really count down and type at the same time, I'll try again with the ten key. 60,590,58,57,56,55,545,53,52,52, no, that takes way too much concentration, but at least now I've exceeded twenty minutes. by one minute. thank you. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='I am very stressed out right now for several different reasons. For starters, I was half way done typing this paper when my computer messed up and everything was erased. Also, I have fake nails which makes it very difficult to type. At this moment, I am trying to write this psychology paper yet all I can think about is everything else I have to do. I wish I had a pen and lots of post it notes with me at all times because I am always thinking of things that need to be done, yet I can never seem to remember them. I am constantly bombarded with thoughts of what books I need to go buy, what sections I need to read for what class, and how I am going to pass this semester living in Castilian. It is wild and very loud which makes it very difficult to study. Also, my ex-boyfriend Derek is in the hospital. He has Multiple Sclerosis and it happens to be very bad right now. I feel so guilty because I have not had the chance to visit him since he has been admitted into the hospital. I think that my mom and I are going to send him some flowers, though. We broke up almost two months ago and he has had a difficult time excepting that fact. It makes me sad to know that he is in the hospital doing absoultely nothing while I am away at college having the time of my life. I don\\'t want him to think I don\\'t care about him anymore or that I have forgotten about him, but this is my own way of really moving on. Last night we had our first date dash for my sorority. I invited this guy named Jordan who lives at Castilian. He is really good looking and we had a lot of fun together last night. Usually I am intimidated by good looking guys, but for some reason I find him very easy to talk to. We also had fun dancing together which is a definate plus because I often feel self-conscious when dancing with good-looking guys. I am a little upset becuse he left me after we got back to Castilian. He told me that he was going to go talk to his friends for a few minutes and that he would be right up. Too bad he came up an hour later when we had already left. I am not even that mad though because I know he feels very bad about it. I am hoping that he invites me to Delt pledge line. I am also very excited because this guy I met and dated at camp this summer wrote me an e-mail! It may sound pathetic but I was really glad to get it. He is a lot older than I am so I was expecting him to forget about me after camp. We are planning on getting married in four years as long as \"college doesn\\'t change me. \" He is a TA at OU and is one of the most interesting guys I have ever met. We share a lot of the same beliefs and have such a good time together. When I graduate from college we are going to move to a beach in Mexico together. We just sarcastically talk about that, but I wouldn\\'t mind it being a reality!! The other night I put some closure on an event that I had needed to for years. It felt really good to do that. And now I am going to put closure on this paper because all I can think about is what I need to do and how I need to be back up at school soon so I can start getting ready for the game. '),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"It뗩 a fact: There are students across the United States who are vegetar- ian and/or health conscious, and school cafeterias should be required to provide low-fat and/or vegetarian lunch options for them. Even more importantly, many teenagers dietary decisions are not only based on health concerns but also religious and/or moral issues. In this day and age, an individual's eating habits often re遼ect his or her identity. For these rea- sons, it's imperative that each school's cafeteria menu be as diverse as its student body.Just by reading headlines in any of the major news magazines, it becomes clear that the United States is a nation that needs to slim down. In every town and city, there are an abundance of fast food restaurants that lure teenage customers with fast, inexpensive, and tasty food, but these foods are typically unhealthy. Unfortunately, school cafeterias, in an effort to provide food that is appetizing to young people, mimic fast food menus, often serv- ing items such as burgers and fries, pizza, hot dogs, and fried chicken. While these foods do provide some nutritional value, they are relatively high in fat, and many of them, namely burgers, hot dogs, and fried chicken, are clearly not designed for vegetarians.Many of the lunch selections currently offered by most school cafeterias could be made vegetarian and/or more healthy with a few simple and inex- pensive substitutions. Veggie burgers, for example, offered alongside beef burgers, would give both vegetarians and the health conscious more options. A salad bar woud also serve the dual purpose of providing both veg- etarians and low-fat food eaters the opportunity for a satisfying meal. This is not to say that accommodating every desire or food preference is plausi- ble, but students should have the right to be served foods that coincide with their life choices.\"),\n",

I am really glad that I came down this labor day weekend to see the family. My uncle is very mean he needs to be a bit more nice to me. He always makes fun of me ant telling me that I need to stay up in Austin and that I can\\'t come down for the homecoming football game. I need to move to another room where the air conditioner is not so loud. I need time to think and be alone. My sister really needs to turn the volume on the TV down while I still do my homework. It is not fair that I am a very considerate person and then there are people who aren\\'t towards me. Right now I am listening to my country music while I am typing. I find that country music soothes me and it very easy to understand. This always runs through my head: Why does this Hispanic girl listen to country? I feel that this is what runs through peoples minds, it runs through my sisters mind, she likes to listen to rap, R&B, and \"party music\",  and I never ask her why she likes that type of music. I don\\'t mind that music either, but I prefer my country. Another thought that crosses my mind is: how come this girl doesn\\'t listen to tejano music? I ask myself if I am adopted in the family, because it takes me awhile to get something\\'s, I have this hyper personality, and I have an \"Irish persons\\'\" chin. I am smelling the fresh grapes that have just placed in front of my face. I have a bad habit of smelling things. I also have a bad habit of constantly washing my hands or using antibacterial hand sanitizer. I think that I am obsessive compulsive in something\\'s. I always feel the need to be clean, and being organized. It is quite funny how as I get older I need to be clean, but when I was younger, I didn\\'t care if I got dirty, or if I didn\\'t take a bath; I hated taking baths. I am noticing that the time is running out on me and that I doesn\\'t feel like it has been 20 minutes, it seems a lot faster.

       " Document(page_content=\"Personally I feel really stressed out. I am a freshman at a very big university. I hardly know anybody and I feel very depressed and lonely all by myself. I am really close to my family so it is very hard to be eight hours away from them. I know this is a new experience, but I am just simply not happy here right now. Many people tell me that I'll get used to it, but I wish the process of adjusting could be a lot faster. I feel as if I should just give up this great opportunity to be at a great university and just go back home. I don't want to let anybody down, for example my whole family. The pressure to do good in school and not give up is so intense. I want to do something with my life, but sometimes I just look for the easy way out. I didn't know that adjusting to college life would be so difficult. How am I supposed to keep up with all this work that is assigned to me. My time management and study skills have not kicked in yet. I miss my whole family back at home. All I can do is get stressed out, I need to find a way to just chill out. I'm worried about basically everything I can think of. I don't know if I'm going to pass my classes, can I manage much longer here by myself, and are people going to accept me for who I am. I'm just not ready for such a drastic change as this one. I have hardly any money left, and I have not even found a job yet. I really need some help to figure out what I am going to do. I really don't know what buses to take to get to certain places. I get really frustrated reading all sorts of maps. Many times I feel as if I'm not even smart enough to be at a great university like this one. I think that is what my problem is, I just don't give myself enough credit. My brother tells me to think positive and he believes that I will make it here. I can not wait to go back home and see my whole family again. I wish I could be a Senior with only one year to go. Though that is not the case because I am a freshman, with many more years to go. Then again what else better do I got to do than studying and working. I would simply waste time and my life doing nothing at all. I want to be successful in life and have a good paying job. I know that is the reason I am willing to study and work hard. Knowing that when all this is done a job will be open to me. Hopefully a good paying job to support all my dreams in life. I really do hope I can make it here at UT. Right now as a freshman I really need all the hope and desire to help me get through this year. Hopefully when this year is over I will be glad because I made it through all my classes. I know study groups would really help me right now. I really dislike reading, but I know I'll have to do a lot of reading as a college student. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"I'm mad because I had just typed for twenty minutes and now I have to do it all over again because something happened to my laptop. AHHHHHH, I'm mad. Anyways today I turned 18. I'm so happy. Now I'm just going to write about anything because I'm hungry and tired. Today was a good day until this stupid thing happened. I'm mad. Tomorrow I'm going to San Antonio and I hope me three friends from Dallas can come visit me. It'll be all of them, Johnny, Cleo, my mom, and my two sisters. Lauren's letter made me cry. It was about how proud she is of me and all that good stuff. It was sweet too. Jesse made me cry yesterday because he got me something for my birthday and I thought he hated me since I'm with Johnny and all. That was sweet of him, but I wouldn't consider going back with him because of all the bullshit he put me through. He used to hurt me more emotionally than physically, but he did both at times. My other writing assignment was all nice and this one is all about bad things. Anyways, being 18 will be cool. I finally get to go into the club legally, meaning without a fake id. I also get to get my own bank account, either Wells Fargo or the University Federal Credit Union. I also get to go get my driver's license, because I never went to driver's education. Yeah! Okay, I'm a little happy now. Johnny is a good boyfriend though. He really cares about me and puts me first on what he should put me before. Like he rather be with me than his friends. That's cool sometimes, but I saw him this summer just enough to know that he really likes me. He hasn't called me yet. Oh oh I'm sad again. I miss him, and I'm glad I get to see him and all my friends tomorrow, hopefully my friends. I still have homework or should I say dormwork to do. HAHAHAHA! Okay that was corny, but I'm still cool. Oh yeah I'm going to a party at around 9:30. Oh oh I guess I'll have to call Johnny by then if he doesn't call me. He said he was going to the mall, so maybe that's where he's at. I know he had practice today so he got out at 5, but he still hasn't called me. Well it's still light outside, so I guess that's okay. Two more minutes and I hope the my laptop doesn't mess up again.

       " Document(page_content='Sitting here in front of my large window, I notice the rays of sun filtering into my dorm room. Everything feels fresh and clean, except for that pile of clothes laying next to my bed. I love warmth any form of it actually. Sometimes I wonder why my hands and feet get so cold. Does my heart not pump hard or fast enough? My old special boyfriend used to tell me, \"cold hands, warm heart. \" That was something his mother used to say. I guess she had cold hands too. Right now, I am wondering about my present faith and how that should impact or change my actions and choices. I am no way questioning my faith in God, but instead, how such faith should be transforming me throughout this transition period that I am experiencing. For instance, ever since going through rush and pledging, I have been put into many situations that I am not normally used to. Basically, my biggest concern is partying and or drinking. For me personally, I feel that alcohol is something that I really don\\'t need to have fun. Then, why did I go against my believe and have a drink anyway? After confronting myself in front of my god of such temptation and hypocrisy, I have done much better. Going to the parties, I merely say, \"No thanks, I\\'m fine\" when offered the drink. I am so blessed to have the friendship of Jeff. It\\'s funny how close or connected you can feel to somebody when you\\'ve only known them for a couple of months. Some of my friendships that have lasted for years are not nearly as close as the companionship that I am experiencing with Jeff right now. The only problem is that I feel myself really starting to like him. Actually, in reality, deep down I have what they call a \"crush\" for him ever since we met at the Christian camp that we worked at together. I\\'m not sure what he thinks he is so incredibly complimentary to me, so I have the suspicion that he may reciprocate some of my feelings. All of our discussions circle around God and Jesus. I have never known anybody so passionate for their believes. Overall, it makes me feel like I should be moving in a different direction, a higher one with my relationship with Christ. This takes me back to the partying scene  What I see there is not glorifying God or His name. Yet, if I can, in some way, glorify His name while I am there, then my actions will coincide with my believes, right? In a way, the only thing I can count on is prayer and patience. It makes me think of Moses and his life in Egypt. By faith and trust in God, Moses and his people passed through the Red Sea. I have faith in my Lord that He will provide me with direction and strength, like he promised to Moses in the Bible. This leads me to think about my education. Sometimes I wonder what my future will be like  What am I going to major in? How many years of college will I attend? Will I have a good job? Will I be married? Will I have children?  the questions are endless and sometimes it can even be entertaining to imagine how things will be. I\\'ve noticed that when I think about things like this, I always see the fairy tale side of the story. I see myself with a wonderful education, a highpaying and fun job, an incredible husband, and three cute and perfect kids. This fairytale imagination of mine can lead to bad things or to a lost in the grasp of reality. I remember going into high school coming from a small, private middle school and thinking that I would be playing varsity everything, would have tons of new friends, and I even thought that I would be dating a cuter, older guy. Well, this was not the case. Things happened very differently. I ended up, by the end of my high school career having all of these things, but in a different way. I had six very close girl friends (not tons), I had a special guy in my life (actually a month younger than myself), and I made varsity softball (after two years of working really hard). Yet, looking back, I am so incredibly pleased as to how my life has traveled so far. So, looking ahead, I really must understand that as much as I want to pave the way for myself, that sometimes things happen differently than planned. Yet, there is a reason and there is a plan. Even when negative things occur, there is some kind of positive outcome, whether it\\'s realized the next day or ten years down the road. Bad things are going to happen  it\\'s inevitable, but it\\'s essential to try to look at things in a different light, a '),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"I hate driving in Austin. There is never any parking and there are scratches on cars everywhere. People are so impolite when it comes to cars. Jay just kept running in to this car just because he didn't care about his own, someone hit my brand new car. And now I have no paint there, if my parents find out they are going kill me. My mom didn't want me to take it with me. I hope the body shop does a good job. That is my main concern. I had a headache this morning. I think from thinking too much and from drinking last night at the frat house. My roommate was being nice to me this morning. Jerry told me she talks about me and that we both know we annoy each other. my dad said we wouldn't get a long from the beginning. And boys are so much trouble. Why does Sak always have to do this to me? I think I will finally answer his question truthfully now. I thought I had been, but he was right, I'm still hiding something. I don't understand what he means when he keeps asking me what I want. And then he says not to want anything. Why must he always try to be the good guy? I don't know if he is telling me the truth. If he says he could have fallen for me then why does he tell me not to want anything? This boy is driving me nuts. I don't understand why he keeps doing this. Deep down, I think I know the answer. But I guess I hide from things a lot. People always say I hide myself. Sak says I hide myself in questions. I do. I never answer personal questions. I answer them with questions. I don't know why. Maybe I do need a psychiatrist. I think too much. I think I scare Sak. Because he just got out of a long relationship and he fell in love with the girl and she broke his heart. I don't like her. She doesn't like me either. I've never spoken to her face to face but she does not exactly give you those warm fuzzy vibes. She looks at me funny. I think she's stringing him along. That's why he does this to me. But then he told me I was wrong. He said he doesn't want the past and that he can't. I think it scares him to let himself go. For some reason I think he's the person who can help me figure myself out. He saw through me hiding behind questions. But I think it's because I don't doubt him. I trust his opinions and his thoughts. That's something I don't do with most people. I trust him. Which surprised me. It usually takes me a long time to get close to someone. Maybe because I am always hiding. For some reason I think he has the key to unlock whatever it is I am hiding. And I think he knows exactly how to open what ever it is that I can't open myself. That's what I want, I guess. I want to tell him the truth but I can't. Because like him. I am hiding. We're both hiding. Only he does a better job at it. Probably because he is a guy. Why do I trust him? I don't understand that. But sometimes I think he says things just so he is not the bad guy. Why do I trust him so much? I think because sometimes he reminds me of myself. I remember when I first met him; I was not attracted to him. He looked cunning to me. Like he had the wits to take advantage of people because he was so smart. But then I think he also has the heart not to. That's why I think I started to like him. He has a good heart. And I think that's one quality that is hard to find. Oh my gosh! I guess this answers his question of what I think about him. I think I will give him a copy of this one day? I will tell him the truth. The entire truth of what I thought when I first met him until now. But I also want him to tell me too. Because I don't want to be the only one who opens up. But I don't think that will ever happen. I think my twenty minutes is about to be up. And I have such a bad memory; I don't remember anyone's name. I feel so bad. Why can't I remember? That's unfair to me because people know who I am but I have no idea who they are. I need to work on my memory. \"),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"Right now I am wondering how can I fit into college. I am wondering what is it that makes people think different than other people. Why is it that some people can do their homework right when they get it and other people procrastinate until the very last minute. Now my mind is totally blank. I am wondering why I cannot connect my thoughts to reach a conclusion. I am I going to be judged by how I write this. Does this accurately reflect my intelligence level. Again I am stopped by the nothingness that I am thinking. Its as if at one moment I am this intelligent individual and the next I am this ignorant fool that cannot manage to continuously write for twenty minutes. As I sit in my dorm writing this I am wondering whether or not I could be doing something else more fun. It is quite lonely in this room. For the most part I think what would solve a lot of my problems is a girlfriend. Someone to talk to that will fill this uncertainty of who I am. For the most part I have never been in love with a girl. What I want is exactly the opposite. I am ready for a relationship. Now instead of going on about this I am reflecting on what I just said. I am thinking is there something wrong with me because all the things seem so negative. But there are also very good things also. I think about how lucky I am to get such a great education from this university. I realize that not many people have this chance. I hope to really discover who I am in the next four years. I think that maybe the reason I have been writing all these negative things is because I am sick. I have a really bad cold and maybe it is effecting the way I think. Ok on to a different topic. I was just watching the road rules on MTV and they were talking about how your childhood effects you later in life. I think this is the perfect case with me. In my family we never really showed any emotions. Not once have I ever told my mom that I love her. Maybe that is the reason it is so hard for me to get into a good relationship. I feel that my relationship with my parents is exactly like my relationship with anybody else that I have been close to. I don't really open my self up to anybody. All my emotions are behind a wall of shyness. My mom always said that I was shy. Maybe she negatively reinforced why I am so shy. But enough about that. I was just thinking about an amazing experience that I had with my dad last week. I was in my parent's room playing guitar. My dad comes in and starts playing along with me. My dad and I don't really do many things together so this was one of the most emotional experiences in my life. I was happier than ever before. My dad took the time to show me some new tricks on the guitar as I played along with him. It was such an amazing experience. Well I think that I have run out of time. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"I don't know how to start a paper like this but I'll do my best. I really miss my mom and my sister, but most of all I miss my boyfriend Michael. He means so much to me and I feel as if our relationship is falling apart because I live a 100 miles away. I don't know how to get over this feeling of loneliness. I meet a lot of people but I still always think of him. He is so understanding too. He said he would understand if I wanted to date other guys. But to be honest with you, I don't. I know I am too young right now to know if my feelings are real but no one up here even compares to him and that really scares me. I cry every night because I miss him so much. I'm tired of crying and feeling scared. I want Michael to be here with me but that is impossible. I went home this past weekend and I realized how much I loved it. I never wanted to come back to Austin. I hate it here. Nothing is secure and there is no one to count on. I wish I could go back home but I can't. I would transfer somewhere closer but I am in one of the top business schools and if I get out then I might never get back in. Don't get me wrong, this is an outstanding school, I am just so homesick. I guess in time though it will get better. Everyone says that the first few months are hard for freshmen. It is such a big adjustment to make. I just hope I will adjust. What if I never do?  Then what happens?  Am I to be unhappy forever?  That is how I feel right now. That I will never be happy again as long as I am here and Michael is down there. Maybe I will feel like that for 2 more years, maybe I won't. One can never know. Sometimes I write poetry to ease my mind. I find that it really helps me express my feelings. Whoever is reading this, do you know of a poetry class or something that I could take?  I think I would really like that. I also want to  learn how to play the piano. Then Michael could play the guitar and I could play the piano. That would be interesting. I wish Christmas holidays would come so I could go home for an extended period of time. I never thought that I would miss it this much, but I do. I think I want to live in my hometown when I grow up. It is such a nice town. Everybody knows everybody and it is so safe. And there I won't be alone. I hate being alone. I'm tired of being alone. I have friends here but they can only do so much. It takes that extra person to really get you over the hump, unfortunately he does not live here. Maybe someday, we can be together again. At least that is what I dream of at night. He is the only one that makes me truly happy. well, time is up! \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Right now I am feeling kind of loney because I haven't really talked to anybody for about 6 hours. I'm not the kind of person who usually keeps to myself. I am very social, but with the size and and stress of college life, making friends is kind of the last thing you want to think about. Even if you do make friends sometimes you never really keep in touch with them. I'm guessing that I'm not the only one to feel like this beacause every day as I walk from class to class I see hundreds of other students walking by themselves and I can only guess that they too feel lonley at some point in the day. Also, I;m starting to think that college life isn't what I expected to be. In a way it is kind of easy because there are no eight hour class days for most people like in high school, but because of the size of some of my classes I don't really get the kind of personal attention I would get in high school. all the time I hear music in my head. It can range from something I just heard on MTV a couple of hours ago to some classical music or something we played in my high school band. Music is a big part of my life. In high school I was in the band for four years and other than making me a better player, it also made me more social and open with my feelings. I wanted to get into band over her at UT, but I never auditioned. I didn't think I was ready. I didn't think that I would be on the level of the rest of the members, and that fear was partly why I never tryed out. I want to try out next year but I have no instrument to practice on because it is too expensive to purchase. I don't consider my lonliness to be a bad thing because I'm not really sad. While in college I learned that sometimes you need your own time to just relax and think to yourself. All in all I'm happy with the way my life is going because I know that in the future college will pay off. \"),\n",

I hear that the football team is using more of a passing game and I wish I was there for it all. I need to call my friend Jonathan, I can't wait to go visit him at Texas A&M.

I wish I hd the time and money to take driing lessons this summer, then I could at least go to driev on a track if I had the car. Theer are too many things I want to do when I grow up.

It gies me a lot more freedom. I can't wait for this weekend, hopefully I can get enough peopel together to go cliff diing.

       " Document(page_content=\"Writing about what I am thinking will be a new experience for me. I just got back from psychology class, so naturally I am thinking about psychology. The way I learn is that I review everything said in class in my mind for at least 30 minutes after class. Now that I am doing the writing assignment I have other things to think about. my roommate is cleaning out the refrigerator. I honestly think that she is one of the most histerical persons in the world. my other two roomates are engrosed in the television which basically means that they are compeletely useless for the next four hours (unresponsive to almost anything excep for maybe a fire in the house) maybe they will talk to my roommate that is cleaning out the frig. during a comercial. Kate, the one cleaning out the frigerator just called the two couch potatoes re and tard, that made me laugh. Trying to keep one line of thought is really hard for me. I listen to everything that goes on around me and have to have a thought about it. It makes it really dificult for me to study most of the time. I cannot study at home because I have to talk to all my roommates or listen to them being crazy or something normal (that does not happen very often around here though)  I also cannot study at libraries because I am a people watcher. I like to just sit and watch people. I learn a lot about people that I don't even know just by watching them interact with their friends, or even how they walk. I also suffer from severe migranes, which makes my life interesting when I get a really bad one. I think I have almost overcome them, but I do have one right now. all I have to say about it is AGHHHHHHHH. My mind almost automatically switches to thinking about Alexander when I have nothing else to think about. he is my best friend and I love hanging around him. he just broke up with his girlfirend and I just broke up with my boyfriend so we have a lot of crying to do around each other. my exboyfriend was really bad for me. it took me two and a half years to be able to say that outloud. I think the only reason that I went out with him, and stayed with him was because he was the first guy to acknowledge my existence. I guess I didn't have very much self esteme when I met him, but now I do, and now I realize how bad he was for me. Alright, it think that my 20 minutes are almost up, so I am going to go eat something and get ready for water polo practice. adios. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='At the moment, the only thing that is going through my mind is how I will make it through college if I remain a procrastinator. Thus, I am completing this assignment because I feel that I need to make changes in my study habits. Moreover, I need to succeed at UT because I cannot afford to let my parents down. My parents have worked exceptionally hard to obtain their current status; it would be a total waste of their time and my time and of course, a total waste of money if I fail in college. Thus, failing is not possible. Occasionally, I ponder whether or not my parents see me as a failure. At times, I feel, as though, I am a failure because I am constantly being compared to my older brother. Everything that I do is not good enough and that I should be more like my brother; I guess one could say that I am always in my brother\\'s shadow. Moreover, it is not only my parents that make the comparisons, but my aunts and uncles also make similar comparisons to other family children. Because they do this, I constantly feel depressed for short periods of time. In order to cope with this, I am apt to finding companionship and understanding through several short love relationships. Each of these \"flings\" can be sought as a substitute for happiness. However, I am now more knowledgeable about stuff like that because I know that these relationships are fun and all, but this relationships only make things worse. Not to mention that they only help you obtain temporary happiness. There is one thing good that has come of these experiences; I believe that I have found happiness with another. She makes me happy in all aspects of life and she actually seems to care about me for who I am and not someone else. When I am around her, she encourages me spiritually whether or not she does it intentionally. Surprisingly enough, she actually understands me without having me to explain anything; I guess you can say she\\'s my soul mate, but there is one thing I am sure of, I love her with all my heart. In fact, she has been the only girl I have actually told that I love her and actually meant it. Just thinking about it at the moment makes me smile. '),\n",
       " Document(page_content='As the new kid in town, I was eager닲k, desperate닶o make new friends, and fast. My dad had just accepted a promotion that required a transfer, and we moved from Chicago to Oakland, California, just a few days before I was to begin the sixth grade. I didn뗪 even have a chance to get to know any of the kids in the neighborhood.After the 遼rst day of school, I could tell that Charlie Jenkins was the one who would make me or break me. He was a bully for sure, but he was so good-looking and charming that everyone seemed to like him. He was clearly the center of power in that classroom, and I knew I would have to win his approval. I just wasn뗪 sure what I뗛 have to do to get it.110  My answer came at the end of the third week of school, when Ms. Har- court gave us our second writing assignment. We뗛 been reading and dis- cussing fables, and now it was our turn to write our own. That afternoon, Charlie cornered me on the playground.He teased me about being a new kid, yet he seemed interested in the fact that I was a good writer. Our teacher, Ms. Harcourt had read aloud one of my poems in class just yesterday, and obviously he was paying attention. I admitted that I had a 遼air for writing, and at 遼rst I was 遼attered that he noticed. But, he had an ulterior motive.Hey, new kid, hold on a second, he said, standing between the gate and me. You seem to be pretty good with writing.뢕Yeah, you do alright, alright, he replied. I뗣l tell you what, he said, moving closer, until his face was just a few inches from mine. Why don뗪 you just write an extra fable, one for you, one for me? Let me see what you can do.렙o that was it. I was going to do Charlie뗩 English homework for him.That was the price I was going to pay to be accepted.Charlie didn뗪 wait for an answer. Bring two fables to school on Mon- day, he said. That would give him time to copy it over into his own hand- writing to submit to Ms. Harcourt on Tuesday.Over the weekend, I wrote two fables, both of them quite good, I thought, but one was de遼nitely better than the other. On Monday morn- ing, I met Charlie in the schoolyard as planned.Here뗩 your fable, I said to Charlie, handing him a piece of paper. I gave Charlie the fable that I thought was inferior, keeping the better fable for myself, and turned to walk away.He questioned me about the quality of the paper, read it quickly, and decided that it passed muster. Without saying thank you or goodbye, he swaggered off into the building.A few days later, Ms. Harcourt returned our fables. I looked at my paper, expecting to see an A or A+, but my grade was an A-. Then I looked over at Charlie. He was holding his paper up high so I could see his grade: A+. I knew the fable I뗛 kept for myself was better. Perhaps Charlie뗩 charm was factored into his grade.Fortunately, I only had to do one more assignment for Charlie before he and his family abruptly moved to another town. Now Charlie was going to be the new kid in the classroom. I often wondered what he had to do there to be accepted.111  '),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"I don't really think there is much of a purpose to this assignment. Granted, I realize its purpose but do not find it to be entirely essential to this course. I do realize, however, that this   experiment   is to be able to tap into the minds of students for a multitude of reasons. One, assuming the student submitted factual personal information (i. e. name and social security number), then certain concerned faculty members can tap into the minds of students they, a) don't like, or b) about which they are concerned. Of course, this can be helpful to understand a student better, or should that student be suicidal, intervene in a timely manner. Unfortunately, if these submissions are not read when they are first processed, then the suicide could take place without due intervention. Of course now, whoever is reading this is probably evaluating my deep psychological reasons for even mentioning suicide. I am sure that this is being analyzed as my subconcious admitting to facts that my cognizant mind would never release. This, however, is not true. While one must accept the fact the subconscious and conscious directly interact, rarely does one prevail over the other. Granted, we have absolute control of the conscious--or at least, more control than that of the subconscious. I am sure, that by now, for a 17 year old college student, I have begun to come across as some sort of pyschological analyst who has put entirely too much thought into this essay and that, for the most part, this is a typical essay and those who submit similar writings are merely trying to impress the reader with their psychological knowledge prior to and INTRODUCTORY course. This is rediculous. As an instructor, s/he probably does not care how much one particular student knows or what their analytical take on this assignment is. And thus, I shall switch from this entirely too practical frame of mind to a more entertaining frame of mind. Why don't we (yes,   we.  As in, the poker players inside my head. Actually, I'm not a fan of poker, so we'll say that we're playing four-man Chickenfoot (dominoes). Please note that the use of   four-man   was not a sexual comment, but the use of   man   was simply to imply that there are four /participants/ in the game of Chickenfoot in my mind. As long as we're discussing dominoes, how about a little trivial information?  Afterall, one does not know when s/he will appear on a radio quiz or a game show. The dots of dominoes and die are known as   pips.   You may recognize   pips   from the rock-n-roll band   blah-blah-blah and the Pips.   This, obviously, as my age has already been discussed, was before my time, and thus, I cannot recall the name of the lead singer, but merely   the Pips. ) discuss my roommate. What to say about Patrick?  Well, I should not attempt to sum him up in words because it would do him no justice. Not that he deserves justice for his unsanitary, habitually lazy style of living, but he is human and our Declaration (let us be patriotic on Sept. 11th) so demands that every   man   (please revert to prior parenthetical insertion upon the proper intent of the usage of   man  ) be allowed the same just (the root of   justice) opportunities. Patrick has found that his calling to life is to frighten or shock people by the way he dresses. I assume that this is a phase, though its onset was around three years ago. He likes to present himself as a very demonic, Gothic rocker. Upon conversing with his girlfriend (aside from her abhorance of this behavior) he does it merely to get a reaction from people. His sole intentions are to be noticed. In fact, that later branches into his very strong desire to be famous some day in life. According to Erin, his girlfriend, he won't make it because he doesn't have the personality. She said he's too submissive. I can completely agree with this as he has wrapped himself (by his own will, mind you) around Erin's stubby little finger. Inside of him, somewhere, he has the need to feel wanted and maybe to a degree where he needs to feel submissive. Who knows?  Let's not talk about Patrick. We're going by fives. 2+3+5+10 = 20 points. I'm kicking butt. Reverting back (as I like to keep my segways under control) to the comment of   let us be patriotic on Sept. 11th,   when will this day be commemorated as a national holiday?  Do not you think it will be soon?  Afterall, if we have D-Day (whenever it falls) why shouldn't we have a day to observe the day when international terrorism (or so we assume it was) attacked America?  It will happen--soon. This is my prediction. I don't think that the day should be so sad. Afterall, people die every day. We don't celebrate all of their lives. Granted, this is on a broader spectrum and affects the patriotism of this nation, but there is no need to mourn eternally. Ahh. Bah. My 20 minutes is up.

       " Document(page_content=\"I have never considered myself a good student. I never studied in high school, and did not expect anything to change once I got to college. Now I find myself in my dorm doing my homework in advance. I wonder to myself, why? I am not the type of person to do things in advance, but now I am. I think the overwhelming challenge of college has presented itself to me. I used to be the person that would drop anything to go party, but now I'm in Austin, were there are many parties, but I am in my room typing a paper that isn't due until Friday, and it's only Sunday. I think that college has changed my way of thinking and acting, and I want to know why? I find myself wanting to learn, instead of having to learn. The thought that all of this studying will make me a smarter person, instead of just help me pass the test is actually a refreshing one. I still wonder to myself, why is this change happening now? Is it the transition from high school to college what is driving me to be a smarter person? I think that the challenge of studying and making good grades is actually helping me to become a better person. Or am I becoming a better person? Because of so much studying, and the quest for knowledge, I have less time for the people that I love. So is this good for me, or bad for me? Why do I study better when I am back home in Temple, TX? Is it because there are less distractions? In one hand there is Austin, where there is so many distractions, like Sixth Street and parties. In the other hand there is Temple, where all my friends are and all of the hometown parties. I have no idea why I study better when I am at home. I hope these are questions that I can answer after taking this course. I have never wanted any thing as bad as I want a 4. 0 this semester and I don't know why. This is good for me, but why the sudden change. For some weird reason I can not quit asking the question, why do I want to study so much? The key word is want. I do not feel that I have to study, but instead I feel that I want to study. This is such a leap from where I was only a few months ago. Have I done myself harm by changing so rapidly? Will this wear off after I get accustomed to being in college? I hope that it does not, because I like the fact that I want to study and do well in school. Why did I not find this way of thinking in high school? If I had would it have made a difference? I am not sure what made me such a different person in high school, but I would love to know, what was the catalyst behind this tremendous change in my attitude. Is there anyway that I could have caused this change if I had wanted to? I do not think so. The jump from high school to college is what has caused me to be a better student. Why do we as humans look back at things that we have done in the past and wish we could change them? After all it was us that did them. How can we now look back at a situation and make a different decision? I tend to look back and wish to change things, but then I think to myself, that I was the one that made the decision in the first place. I don't know what causes me to look back so often, but I think that I reflect more often then others. Is it because I was happier at the time that I am reflecting? I feel the same know as I always have, but I am a more serious person. I am a happy and easygoing person, by nature, but when I am going to school, I feel more uptight than usual now. I used to look at school as a time to hang out with friends and goof off, but know there is none of that, I am only here for one reason, to do a good job. Hopefully this will carry over to when I get a job and am supporting a family. I think that this attitude will help me to be a very hard worker. I find it relieving to write as I just have for 20 minutes. Actually I went over the time because it was so interesting that I was thinking in this way. I did not know that I had so many questions about myself, until I sat down and wrote about them. I found it easy to ask myself questions without giving answers. Maybe after taking the Psychology class I will be able to answer some of my own questions. \"),\n",

I am not a big fan of the saxophone. I don't like Kenny G. Even though he doesn't play the sax. I just called my best friend at OSU. She hates it there. The thing is, writing for a good twenty minutes is hard. I got all my thoughts out just a minute ago because I wrote in my journal. I have my own website where I have journal entries and pictures and various other interesting things. After this I will do the pretesting. I hear it is pretty long. That's never fun. I hate the food at Andrews. It tastes like a bunch of nothing. I also feel like keeling over after I eat the food, too. I am not using Microsoft Word for this. This is straight typing into the submit form. You think in a room of 540 kids there would be some boy to catch my eye. guess what? Not one. I still love my exboyfriend. Why do I jump back to him? I went to a frat party last Friday. It was fun, but I don't think I could date a frat guy. They are not really my type. I wish I could get over my exboyfriend. But would that be a good thing or bad? Who says I need to get over him? He was my first, possibly my last. I think he has very strong feelings about me too. I wonder though. Boys can be very ambiguous at times. Why can't we all be blunt? My Kirby Lane experience has been forever tainted. My food was cold and I saw a girl toss her cookies in the parking lot. People can be so irresponsible sometimes. They need to know their limit, or just take care of their business in the privacy of their own place not in front of Kirby Lane. My hands are crampy from all this typing. This is an interesting project. Anyway, I am going home this weekend. Back to Grand Prairie. I miss my niece. Her name is Ashley Rene Johnson. She is adorable. She just turned two and I wonder if she remembers me. I hope she is talking more. She is beginning to worry me. she barely talks. A homeless man hit on me today! In front of Bevo's! I was startled, but was I guess flattered. He had sunglasses on, so maybe he saw a distorted version of me. He called me beautiful. Hardly. It is getting cold. I am anxious to reread this writing assignment. It is 3:33. Thank you. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"I'm pretty stressed out right now, I just have to get this paper out of the way so I can start on my other 615 hours of homework. What is going through my mind right now, hmmm I haven't called home enough. I've skipped Biology too many times, but I still need an A. I think the teacher is throwing way too much at us for this to only be a 2 hour class. I can get through it though. What is going on in my mind right now?? Actually, I'm thinking I need to think of something interesting to write about so the person who has to read all these doesn't slip into a coma and die. I have a date tomorrow night with a girl that I hardly know, but she was cute enough I don't know what I think about this date thing every weekend, it is getting very old way too fast. How is that supposed to help me adapt to college life. A date is not necessary for every single event, especially when I am dressed up as Country Club Ken (by choice of course). I just heard from someone that this socalled hot date I have has some personal issues. What is that supposed to mean? No one would go into detail, just that she had issues. She could be a bulimic head case for all I know or it could be something simple like she is very into herself. I have a friend who always says that about someone else, but they couldn't describe it. I'm worried about my roommate. He acts strait but every once in a while I catch him staring at me when I get out of the shower. Now that I think about it, it is extremely hard to write about my constant thoughts, because you have to put effort into typing it out, you cannot just think. In class, that is when I can think continuously without interruption, the things that go through my mind in one hour of lecture can begin with some girl I saw looking at me and end up with my thoughts about my first exam next week. There is one good looking girl on my floor that I keep going back to, I winder if she has issues as well. I have been to her room a couple of times, but I can't decide if it could happen or not, I do not like to go for things unless I am absolutely positive she will say yes. Maybe I think about girls too much, but I am a college freshman boy and what else do we think about besides school occasionally and my lack of money by the second week of the month. How in the world does that always happen to me once I get on my own, I could always manage money at home, but the day I moved up here it just disappeared and now I am already left with hardly nothing. People always told me that, but I never listened. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='I have just finished reading the second chapter of the psychology textbook for class today. My room mate is always playing spades on the internet. I type very loudly. My subwoofer speaker system really looks cool the way I have it set up on my desk. This is a very odd, but interesting, assignment. The combination of the fan and air conditioner noise is driving me crazy. It is like the drone of a prop-plane. My computer is constantly checking for viruses and is always making little \"engine\" noises while I am typing. My room mate has a very odd way of typing. As I am doing this assignment, I am hearing myself talk the words as I type. I am sure that I have always done this, however, until now I have not noticed it. I believe that I just heard thunder. we could use the rain. I can\\'t believe that we had a pop test in spanish today. I have a knot in my stomach. I know that I did poorly on it. I have a great spanish resource. my 501 verbs book. My monitor also makes a noise that sounds like I would imagine electical energy to sound. I want to go home this weekend. I miss my brother. I am going to bring him to Austin sometime to hang out with me and see the sights of UT. What time is it?  I wonder if my package has arrived in the mail room, yet?  I wonder what my dad thinks of all of my difficulties with the percussion ensemble here?  I would like to retreat to Lake Tahoe and bask in the glory of the crystal clear water and the Sierra Nevadas. That was a very random thought. All of the intricacies of the human brain are very amazing. If my cardiothoracic surgery bid does not work out, maybe neurosurgery could be an option. I have never had a class quite like psychology 301. I like the fact that it is web based. If I happen to miss a class, it is relatively easy to track down what was discussed. And even if the web doesn\\'t have the information, the study sessions should cover the material again. I wish that I would have attended the first study session. I wish that I hadn\\'t signed up for the molecular biology honor society. my plate is full already. That is such a strange idiom. I wonder how it came about. I wonder if idiom is the correct term for that expression. I have a very nice printer. It\\'s fast, silent, and very clean looking. I am definitely a strange guy to be admiring his Deskjet!  I had to buy a lot of books for my spanish class. It has turned out to be my hardest class. I do not think that I am going to take any more spanish after this semester. I don\\'t think that I was truly prepared to take spn312k, but I must have guessed well on the Wisconson test. I hope that my friend Cory does well at Rutgers this weekend. I can hardly believe that he was the number one defensive pick in the nation. It seems like just the other day when we were playing together for Cunningham Middle School. Now the guy is 6\\'5\", 245lbs. !  I really enjoy football and I miss the contact, but my I\\'M experience this fall should be a lot of fun without all of the bruises. I really want to lift weights tonight, but I don\\'t believe that I will have time. I also want to train with Daniel, but I don\\'t know what he has planned for tonight either. It feels like I have been thinking for hours, but It has only been a few minutes. This definitely reinforces the fact that the mind is better than any computer mankind can build. At least until some sort of artificial intelligence comes along. And even then, that won\\'t compare because \"artificial\" is in the name. I really hope that my timer goes off soon and I can stop writing. I think that it would be really cool if I could guess the exact time the buzzer will sound without looking at the clock. It would be like ESP. That reminds me of a kid who did a debate over the existence of ESP in fifth grade gifted/talented class. It makes me feel good to say that I have been identified G/T. That\\'s very cocky sounding, but I don\\'t believe that I have told anyone of my identification in years. I have a problem with cockyness. I had better watch out or someone or something is going to come along and put me to shame in embarrasing fashion. '),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"I really wish I didn't have to do this. Actually I don't want to do homework at all. I don't like reading textbooks and that is all we have been doing. I actually didn't even start reading any of my books until I knew I had to for an Economics quiz. This weekend the plan was to catch up on everything and I really didn't. I did catch up on economics, which is the hardest class I'm taking. I am really disappointed that I didn't get to see my friends in Arlington, but I did get to hang out with my parents and that was nice. I miss them but I love college and Austin. I also hope that I get to hang out with my cousin more and get to know her a lot better. Unfortunately our age difference is huge so we don't have too much in common but she has been calling and cooking for me so I don't mind that. Cat's here and she's talking. Jessica is here and she's messing with channels. Earlier we watched the U. S Open after she got home and we watched Justine Henin-Hardenne lose. Yay. Oh, I really have to sneeze and I'm kind of thirsty. I really want to eat some peanut butter and crackers and maybe a taco. One time our fridge was leaking stuff that looked like coke. Today I talked to Alicia's mom more that I talked to her. I actually didn't get to talk to her because her voicemail turned on. I hope she is doing ok at UNT because she hasn't sound happy or upbeat when I have talked to her. I talked to Amanda today too and now I'm so frazzled and distracted. Cat and Jessica are loud and I can't even complete a train of thought. It's kind of scary if a guy has a blow-dryer. Is William Faulkner the dean? I don't know but I'm so excited about UT. Jessica has a lot of clothes, food, and books and I think my dorm room is going to be vacuumed up by her stuff. Today I bought milk, actually my mom bought milk, and then we drove to Kinsolving. Later, I tried to put a fitted sheet onto my bed and it took a long time to put on and Jess made fun of me because I couldn't put it on. I just told Cat that she couldn't have a Kleenex and it was pretty funny. I really like college and all the people I have met so far. They are so nice and I love them.  \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"well here I am sitting in front of this glowing monitor trying not to tell the editor in my head overtake me. It's more difficult than it seems but I must keep trodding. Shoot. I just realized I missed a club meeting tonight. I also remembered about the informal classes Ill be taking Monday. I should also be practicing guitar but I'm too lazy. (Homework for that matter)  Boy it's something else being 27 stories up. People look like small ants moving around in the strangest fashion. Now I don't even know what I'm saying anymore. I feel sick from the food I ate for dinner, and it's inhibiting me from my studies. What else to say. . . . . I remembered I should call Peggy since she left a message the other day, but that can wait till later. Oh, and Rob, well I need to inform him about the Houston concert info. I wonder if those airline tickets to D. C. came in yet. And where are those items I ordered from the catalog?  I'm beginning to worry. I cant believe B of A charges a dollar to merely check a statement from an ATM. They also charge for depositing and withdrawing currency from the bank teller instead of an ATM. outrageous. I'm really looking forward to go back home soon. I'm still homesick, but it's fizzled somewhat since the first few days. Looking at my bookshelf, it reminds that I bought Contact by Carl Sagan, which I keep intending to read, but never get around to it. I hate that. Why did I buy the book?  Well I thought Contact was an excellent movie for the moral implications that are brought up. It's a great thing to see such a science oriented film focus on faith and not mere facts. Carl Sagan must have been a brilliant man. My next door neighbors just turned up the stereo, so there goes the silence. Hmm what song is that?. Oh yeah, semi charmed life. I should look for those guitar tabs later. That reminds me, should go to the party next door on Sat. or not?  I suppose it couldn\\x92t hurt, but then I'd get further behind on my studies. How long have I been writing so far?  Hmm. almost 20 min. I haven't really said anything profound which disappoints me, but then again, this is a stream of consciousness assignment. I'm liking college a lot. It gives me space ponder and let my mind wander. It's amazing the places one can go if you just set your mind free. I don't know why, but sometimes I have an impulsive urge to write poems or songs, but once I get distracted from that sudden drive, I lose the will to do so. I guess I have to be in a certain mood. I noticed that I had mere frequent occurrences when I first got here. Perhaps it was due to the seclusion and sudden separation from friends and family. Being in a strange environment w/o a guardian is harder than I thought. I feel like I'm being forced to grow up faster than I'd like to. But I suppose it builds character, and I have never been one to back down from obstacles. Think of it as a gateway to another world. Hmm time's up. My train of thought has sure been a wacky one. Bunch of random thoughts strewn together.  does this represent a part of who I am?  certainly, but not hardly. maybe a paradox of some sort. one thought to add is that I have been such a weak willed person lately. I have those intentions, but I cant seem to get them to take root. That needs to change, and I guess I do notice a little improvement, but near as much as I'd like  \"),\n",

I miss my home and my miss my family and I miss my girlfriend who is also in fort worth. I always talk to her and I wish she was here all the time. I miss her a lot and all I can think about is being able to talk to her. school seems a little hard. I haven't gotten used to the studying habits yet. I know that I will soon get back into the grove though. I can't wait until I get to go home this weekend. I want to go home every weekend but I know I can't. it is so hot out side and I want things to cool down just a little bit. I want to be able to go out and play but I don't like going to parties and that's all people want to go do. so it seems like there isn't ever anything to do down here unless you go to a party. all I want to do is go home. it is a lot more fun at home. I don't understand why people say college is so fun when I haven't really had any fun yet. I don't want to join any frats because I don't think they're worth it. and I also hear that they make enemies also. and I don't want to make any enemies down here. my classes are kind of confusing. and since I don't know any body in the classes, I don't feel comfortable asking the people next to me questions. the weeks go by so slow. the only thing that I like about school so far is that I get done with school on Friday at eleven o'clock. that way I can leave for fort worth much sooner. my arms are starting to hurt and I still have just gotten started. time is going by so slow. I want to get out of my supplement housing. I don't like having a room with three other guys. and I don't like my room not having a sink or a mirror. I sort of like the big classes though. it makes class seem more fun. I am so sleepy right now. I don't know if I want to do my home work any more. I might just want to go home and take a nap. my room is so cold. we tried to get the a/c turned down but it still blows super cold air. and plus I sleep on the top bunk right by the a/c vents so it blows right on me. I always get a really cold nose in the middle of the night. and I also have a room mate with a really loud alarm. his alarm constantly goes off and he keeps hitting the snooze button. so every nine minutes it goes off again and again and again. it's so annoying. it's like just freaking wake up or turn off your alarm. I don't understand these people. and would be trying to sleep and then he walks into the room and turns on the lights which light up the whole room. and I'm trying to sleep. he has a little lamp but he doesn't use that instead. talk about no consideration. I don't like having to go down the hall to the bathroom just to brush my teeth. or going down to the bathroom just to put some lotion on my face. I want to be able to just wake up and do all that in front of a sink and a mirror that I don't have and what every body else does. I am getting tired of writing and I'm glad that the twenty minutes is almost up. I wonder if you guys are really going to be reading this thing all the way through. I wonder if you think I'm weird for saying some things that I have said. I wonder if I'm the only person that feels this way. last time I played basketball and now I am very sore. it's hard for me to walk around. I think I'm about to fall asleep on the computer. I can barely keep my eyes open. well sorry guy but my twenty minutes just about to up. bye bye and I hope y'all have a good day. \"),\n",

Then, people who are more terrified of terrorists are more likely to support Bush. Hmm. I on the other hand, am not terrified of terrorist because I support Bush and feel safe with his leadership. That\\'s how I would see it. If you are not afraid of terrorism, then you must think that Bush is doing a fantastic job with keeping America safe.

That class is composed of 300 hamsters in an experiment. Don\\'t get me wrong. I don\\'t mind. I\\'m in a fishbowl. Who\\'s not a fishbowl? I am getting very sleepy. hehe I just thought of those guys who use a watch to hypnotize someone till they fall asleep and they say \"you are getting very sleepy\" in this creepy tone. well I feel like one of those guys being hypnotized. yayayaya! only 5 minutes to go! wow this is the best writing assignment ever. this should count for %50 of our grade. it\\'s only fair. ok ok ok what am I thinking? I am thinking that I should be thinking of something to think of. ha that was gay. I\\'m hungry already and I just ate rice and steak. man I am a pig. I just have a big stomach capacity, I can\\'t help it. headache. snot. itchy eyes. 3 minutes to go.

This Festival I can't believe that Cinematexas is almost here in two weeks my life will be totally different. . Having only had eight days off this entire year is just insane. . I think I'm holding up but I feel that I coming apart now. I think that's what I scared about. This year I've really pushed myself tothe limit in terms of what I can do going jback to school crazy extra curricular stuph I've learned so much. Mostly about what kind of person that I am. What am I capable of. Which is some great stuff. But I'm not there yet I 'm almost there though. It's weird in my film classes when people look to me and vthink that I'm a T. A. or look to me for help. It's strange I guess people see good things in me. I like that annd I do the same thing. .

How awkward. oh well I hope she transfers soon. I hate Judy. she's such a bitch. I dunno how she is going to become a psychologist. Gross. she's so insensitive and mean. i have no clue how she is going to become a psychologist. Aren't psychologists supposed to be nice, friendly, understanding, etc. ??

Why the hell would I ever want to get back with a shit head like him. He's so stupid. oh wells. i miss my mommy. it seems like I love her a lot lot more now that I'm away from home.

He's so superficial and stupid. i hope his son doesn't come to Houston and live with us. that would suck so bad. i really have no idea what I would do. He would definitely mess up the whole family. i wonder what Charles is doing right now. i wonder if he really does have feelings for me like he says. i wonder if he still thinks about me and stuff. He's such a dickhead. i bet h already slept with another girl already. Grrrr. what a damn loser. He's almost 24 years old yet he is still a junior. i really would not be suprised if I graduated before he did. hehe. michael is a really nice and cool guy. i'm glad I met him. i wonder if he is gay. that really sucks. guys who usually talk about their fatness usually seem to be gay. i have no clue though. i kinda miss Charlie pooh. oh well I must forget about him. i really need to catch up on my studies I must make a 4. 0 gpa so I can get into a good med school with scholarships and etc. Gosh Poor Catherine. i know her and Eric are having problems. it's just that she doesn't want to admit it. Everytime I bring the subject of him, she tries to avoid it like she doesn't care but I know she does. oh well Poor girl. i hope we have fun this weekend. that would be really great. Yup =) Ok now. it seems like I am running out of ideas to write for this class. i need a haircut bad. Hehe. oh my god I can't believe 90210 is still showing . that's pretty amazing. it's the 10th year since its been running. wow. Jenny Garth is still my idol. she's soo pretty and she dresses so nice and is skinny. i want to lose another 10 lbs. then I will be soo happy. the girl from party of 5 has really grown. i love her hair. thats the next haircut I'm going to have. it looks so nice. ok now. i think it's been 20 minuties and I'm tired of writing so I'm going to go now. byebye =) \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"     Today is a dreary day. The clouds and rain almost reflect the strange mood i have now. I think my thoughts have changed today. after thinking about what my mom said. I almost feel guilty. although i'm just supposed to be happy. I don't really know if what i am doing is wrong or if I just think it is because that is what i have always thought. I want to be quiet. silent. Reflective because I need some time to think and not be social. I don't want to waste any time but i don't want to look back on my time here and feel that i never had any fun. I think i am doing a good job of planning and not doing too much, but i just want to be balanced. I need to go to that church that Kelly went to , but I don't know how to get there and I feel bad that I didn't go today, even though I went to bed at 4. I need to do a better job next week. I really am begining to miss Omar and my family. Living in Austin is fun but I think I am going to get sick of it if I don't take charge of my life now. I want to do things that make a difference and not just flow with the college life. I want to be different and I haven't found exactly what I'm looking for. I still haven't found what I'm searching for. It is really hot in here. I wish I could turn the air down. but Katy is asleep. She is so crazy. I guess I like her as a room mate, it could be a lot worse. But i don't think she is at all a good role model and if anything she will bring me down if I am not careful. I really want to go shopping but I don't have time. Maybe tomorrow. I want to buy so many things. I have so many ideas but I have no money. Whoever said money does not buy happiness. was wrong. I could have so much fun if I had a whole bunch of money. I would go to all the vintage stores in Austin and have the cutest clothes and the greatest room and everything. I think then I would be more confident to go out and have fun and meet people which would bring happiness. right?? I wish that I was bulletproof. I wish Omar was here. We could have such a wonderful life if he just lived here. We need each other. He can't do anything unless i'm there to encourage him and give him advice and help. And i can't do anything unless he is here to give me inspiration and comfort and something to be joyous about. It would be so great. Oh well, i don't think that will happen. Last nite was soo crazy. But I am glad I went, just because I need to experience all that I can so I can really know what I stand for and am comfortable with. If I just stay here and do things I know, then I will never be sure if I am really being real, or just what I think is real. I need to try everything so i will  know what I'm not missing. or what I need to get more involved in. I hope Heather, Athena and I can hang out more and do things because we haven't and they are my best friends. I think it is weird how we are all here, but we never see each other. I can't belive I cut myself on my bed today. That is so retarded. And it really hurts. I think Allison is soo sweet. . we are so alive and it is so funny how Omar and Ramses live the same kind of girls that live in the same house. Haha - we live in the same house, and they live in the same house. that is so crazy. I can't belive it. I love Radiohead. it is so comforting. At least I don't really have to do chores here like at home. i am definitly free. It is a strange feeling but I really like it. It's like, i can do anything and no one will know if I don't want them to. That is a eerie and almost scary feeling. Sometimes, when I consider what tremendous consequences come from little things. I am tempted to think there are no little things.  I hope Omar will write me a song sometime. He really needs to. I can't belive we had that whole talk about little things, and i ever cried! and he still hasn't done anything. I wonder if I just stopped calling him and sending him e-mails, if he would even notice. I would think that naturally he would, but then again I can rarely predict him. He would probably not even mention it, not even miss it. That is sad. I really wish he would be different . He has such potential to be a wonderful , prime boyfriend, but i don't think he really tries as hard as he says he does. Ahh. ohh well, it will work out. I am glad i have him, because I don't want anyone else,. . no one. I a very happy with him and i know we will be so happy together when we finally figure out what we are going to do. Well, this is almost the end. The end of my moments, and feeling. i want some ice cream. . yea i do. I have so much to do today. I love this music. I want to paint. I need to create something beautiful, and be productive. This is actually the beginning. not the end. Here I go. this is going to be one great year. I have promises to keep. and miles to go before i sleep. \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='I\\'m feeling jealous right now. I got an email from one of my friends. She informed me that my x-girlfriend is now dating a new person. It makes me mad. I don\\'t know why. I don\\'t like her anymore. Oh, well, just forget it. I\\'m hot. maybe it has something to do with the recent news. I guess I just need to \"cool off\". I really like it here at UT. everybody is very nice. I\\x92m trying to think of what to type. I\\x92ve got this particular song in my head, and I can\\'t get rid of it. it\\'s aggravating. I\\x92m tired. I wish I could take a nap, but the dorms are to loud. wow, she\\'s pretty. I wonder if she\\'ll be my future wife. maybe, maybe not. I wonder if I should ask Emily to dinner tonight. I can\\'t think of a way to ask her without making it sound like a date. I fear being rejected. I guess that\\'s what pisses me off about my x. she \"just friended\" me, but I think the real reason was never mentioned. I hope she rots in hell. Emily\\x92s really nice. she seems really mature. I almost consider her a big sister, but not really. she just acts like she could be. I\\x92m getting sick of jester food. it all tastes the same. like shit. she\\'s attractive. every girl here is really pretty, with some exceptions of course. so far, it seems like college has been all play and no work, except for this of course. there\\'s so many people here. sometimes it\\'s overwhelming. so much diversity. and yet, so much organization. I really like the atmosphere. the game last night was a blast. I\\x92ve never had so much fun at a game. so much spirit and energy running through the air. being in the band is the best thing that\\'s happened to me in a long time. it\\'s taught me a lot. I think I\\x92ve grown up so to speak. the idea of a computer lab strikes me as funny. all these people here, right next to each other, but there\\'s still a sense of privacy. no one ever seems to look at other people\\'s work. so much organization in so much chaos. I like Macs better than PC\\x92s. I don\\'t know why. they just appeal to me more. I wish I had a girlfriend. it\\'s been a long time since I\\x92ve been with someone. I miss it. I like the fact that my parents live here. we don\\'t always get along, but I think that if they lived in another state, or even another city, I wouldn\\'t be doing half as well here. I like the security. it\\'s nice not having to miss them. and to not be homesick. I wish I could stay here forever. I don\\'t want to have to get a job. but, at the same time, I often feel bad that my parents have to pay for my education. I\\x92ve always been that way. I really love my family, I just don\\'t know how to show it very well. I\\x92m ready to start doing more work in classes. they\\'re starting to get boring. I wonder what\\'s to become of Ginny. I\\x92ve always liked her, ever since high school. she lives so far away, Alabama. I\\x92d love to date her. maybe because while I was with her, I never got the chance. damn, I wish I had the opportunity now. girls are so pretty. why?  sometimes, they get in the way of more important things. sometimes I like the distraction, but sometimes it hurts me. I think I\\x92m going to do well here. no problem. I\\x92m very good at adaptation. I think my time\\'s about up. '),\n",
       " Document(page_content='It\\'s 6:48. I think I\\'ll type up the time as a reference even though there is a timer at the top. As I sit here, looking around and typing without looking at the keyboard, I wonder what my girlfriend is doing since I am using her computer. Can\\'t wait till Monday!  I finally get my own internet set up at my apartment. I feel like I\\'m getting sick. I was sneezing a lot the other day, now I have a slight sore throat. I wonder what the purpose of this assignment is. Is someone actually going to read this or is it just busy-work?  Gah!  I hate this runny nose!  My girlfriend sure has a lot of pictures of me. a little too many?  Hope she is getting a good work-out at the gym right now. I need to find more time to go to the gym now. Going to the gym everyday for a few minutes isn\\'t that good, right?  Wow. I feel like my ex-roommate. All he ever did was study, go to the gym, and hang out with his girlfriend, too. I wonder what I\\'ll do for dinner tonight. I should eat healthier. Learning how to actually cook a decent meal might help. I hope I\\'m doing this assignment correctly. Oh well, if I\\'m not, I can just ask a TA just to make sure. It\\'s only been 6 min and 15 sec?  Wow, this is going to be longer than I thought. Oh look, it\\'s Bloat (a toy from McDonalds that was in the movie Finding Nemo). What a great movie that was. Best children\\'s movie I\\'ve seen in a long time. I\\'m feeling more ill now. This can\\'t be good. Maybe I shouldn\\'t go out tonight. Ugh, that\\'s right- I won\\'t be sleeping over tonight either because she cancelled on me so that her friend can sleep over. Oh well, I\\'ve been spending a lot of time with her recently; it\\'s understandable. I need to find some tissues. There\\'s a roll of paper towels and toilet paper. I think I\\'ll grab some toilet paper. Hahaha- it\\'s just like in elementary when we ran out of tissue boxes; the teacher would sometimes have a roll of toilet paper. *sigh*  I miss those good old simple days. A lot less pressure and life was so relaxing back then. It was good to be young. I know what I\\'d like to do right now!  I want to play counter-strike!  Too bad I can\\'t install it onto her computer. I wonder if whoever is going to read this knows who she\" is. Should be obvious, so no worries. What homework/reading assignments do I need to take care of this weekend. Hmm, I\\'m taking care of this psychology writing assignment right now, I still need to do that one experiment (which is being a pain since it keeps running into that error page and I can\\'t go any further!), LEB, FIN?, maybe a little CMS reading?  I think that should take care of it. Oh wait- got to do the ECO self-homework tomorrow. Look, she is back!  Aw, she is tired from working out. What?!  She just told me how \"everyone\" has commented on my latest pictures on her board!  Apparently, people think it\\'s a good picture of me. I guess it is. I actually like those pictures of me (which is kind of rare). I wonder if I can type like I do when I\\'m online- GRAMMATICALLY INCORRECT!  That would speed up my typing. Look!  I\\'m at 19 minutes now!  19 is a great number. All done now! '),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"I've done this type of assignment before. Sophomore year of high school for mrs. hollingsworth. All I talked about was diet coke, because she had one on her desk. Today I went to class and I though I would be late to spanish because I was coming straight from sociology class. I didn't even lock my bike up right, someone could've pulled the wheel off and taken my frame. I woulda been walking back to my dorm with a wheel, a u-lock, and a frown on my face. It was hard to focus when all I'm thinking about during a class is how stupid I was to lock my bike up wrong. It didn't get stolen so that was good I just rode it back and I was fine. I hate riding along busy streets I never know if I should be on the sidewalk or on the street, the crosswalk or the lanes. It's so crazy, usually I just go back and forth and try not to get run over. this morning I got up and ate yogurt too quickly I felt kinda crazy in the stomach for my first classes. It went away once I was able to drink some water and let time pass. For a while I was wondering whether there was a reason why that yogurt was the cheapest. I always try to find the cheapest stuff at the grocery store. Yesterday was the first day that I used a push basket at the supermarket. I usually just walk around holding all the goods in my hands but there was too much. It was kind of a weird feeling because it was like I was growing up or something. I have to start clipping coupons and writing checks and things like that, yesterday when I was pushing the cart, that was the icing on the cake. Next thing I know I'll be getting married and crap like that. I guess all that stuff isn't so bad, but it seems like I got a grasp for the real world so quickly, but I'm not even in it yet, whatever it even is. I always think about the book Babbit, by Sinclair Lewis. He is painted in the book as some horrible guy who sells out his own beliefs and everything else so he can gain prestige and what not in his community. It's really hard for me becuase he is very human. There are aspects of George Babbit in all of us, and drives me crazy. I have a constant struggle within myself to decide whether or not you should hold strong to minor beliefs and principles and be held back in the system, or if you should try and play the system and get what you can out of it. If you play the system though it's kind of like selling out, you just become an opportunist. But it seems like you have to compromise your beliefs to certain degree. It seems like every decision I make, I don't know if I should do things to appease people and get ahead, or to hold fast to things. I'm not talking about the biggies though, just the small things. I would be afraid though that the more I ignore the small things, I might gradually start into the big things. I don't want to become like Kurtz, he had no restraint and he just got more and more into a state of immorality and all this other stuff. I'd like to think that I had restraint, but I have no clue if I do or not. I can demonstrate restraint in small cases, but Kurtz could too when he was in the confines of society. I don't know if I would revert like he did, I hope not, but no one can say unless they cross the same bridges that he did. Heart of Darkness is definitely my favorite book, it is really thought provoking and there are so many levels that you can interpret at. I read it for school last year and loved it, I read it about five3 times after that too because it's so good. I really like Joseph COnrad, but I usually odn't talk to too many people about him unless I'm drinking and my tongue gets loosened. Most people talk about sex and things like that when they drink. I always talk about Heart of Darkness, William Shakespeare, and Lord Byron. I don't really drink that much, but it's happened before and those were my favorite discussion topics. Once I tried to tell this guy about Freud and the ID, EGO, and Superego. All the sober people told me that I was 100% right in all my statements, but the drunk people just didn't understand. I don't know what to write right now, I have a lot going on right now. Most of my classes seem like they're going to be pretty easy, but I never know. \"),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"TOday was an easy day for me since I only had two classes to attend. IN math, I really had a hard time staying awake. I didn\\x92t know if it was because I knew the lesson already or was it that the teacher was boring the heck out of me. Either way, I was very tired and at times, I just dozed off. In my EDP class, I had to find information on financial aide. I also had to start a checking account at the credit union. By chance in the corner of my eyes, I could a brochure on financial loans for students. So I picked it up and will bring it to class for my presentation. Right now I'm stuck in my room and typing my psychology assignment which is due on Friday. It's an easy assignment because it will be graded on whatever you completed or not. I probably will need this grade to bolster up my average since psychology isn't really an easy class. Tomorrow will be a more challenging day with 3 classes to attend. English at 8 in the morning is a killer time for me. I had no choice but to take that time slot because all the times were filled up. I tries to call TEX many times, but had no luck. Now I have to get used to waking up early every Tuesday and Thursday at about 7:30 in the morning. It's a pain in the butt, but the good thing is that I can come back and sleep some more since my next class is at 3:30 which is psychology. I really need to take a nap before my psy class because last week on Wednesday, I didn't take one and when I attended the class, I had a hard time staying awake. I'm glad that I'm in college now because I feel more independent than at home. My mom would always get on my nerves with all her questions and nagging and now she isn't able to do it anymore. But it gets to a point where I kind of miss the questioning and the nagging which I think is contributed to homesick. I can't wait until thanksgiving when I get to go back and see the family because I really miss my baby brother. I would always take his pillow and blanket just to tease him but my mom would end up shouting at me to give it back. I also miss playing basketball with my 1tenth grade brother. He is trying out for the basketball team at his high school and I hope he makes it. He still thinks he can beat me, but that won\\x92t probably ever be true until I'm about 60 and he's 57. This weekend, I hope to attend the football game with my friends again. I went to the one last week and we blew away Rutgers by a lot. It was a great game because there were a lot of people in attendance and the place was packed. A packful of people screaming and cheering for the longhorn football team was one of the greatest moment I have ever saw because I have never attended a college football game before. It was quite hot and I was wearing jeans which was dumb of me. I definitely learn my lesson and will wear shorts to all the day games. I might even paint my face to show some school spirit. Maybe not. After I finish this assignment, I will have to start working on my English paper which is due next Thursday. I kind of have a idea of what to write about but it might take awhile before I fully understand the assignment. The good thing about it is that my teacher is very nice and she will be willing to help me if I need it. My EDP teacher also mentioned a writing center which I could go to if I have problems starting an idea or need my paper to be edited. I think that is cool because in high school, there wasn't a writing center that would help you with your paper. You had to go to the teacher for help and sometimes they make you do all the thinking even when you don't have a clue. I guess that's one of the luxuries for being in college because people want you to succeed and that's a great feeling to have. The one thing I keep on forgetting to do is to buy my psy book. I may have to run by co-op and see if they have it since BEVO's was out of them. Textbooks are very expensive in college, but it's probably worth it when it comes to things you don't understand or for the test. The good thing is that you can resale them back to the store. I think my time is up so that's all I'm going to write. I think I changed the subject like 6 different times but I think that's the purpose of this essay. So, that's all.   \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Whenever I do assignments like these, I usually seem to write over the required time. I've always been more of a thinker than a talker. I seem to possess the strange habit of going into such deep thought that I am completely oblivious to my surroundings, something that really annoys both my sister and boyfriend. I guess I don't really feel the need to always take part in hincty conversation taking place around me. At the moment I'm wondering if I'm supposed to go to the next line while writing or if I'm supposed to keep writing in one straight line like this. The screen seems to just be going to the right when I type instead of ending and going to the next line. Right now I am listening to Morrissey. I can hear it from the bedroom- I'm sitting in the living room which attaches to the kitchen. When I walked into this apartment for the first time ever, it had a much different feel to it than it does now. This is Eric's apartment, my boyfriend, and it feels bigger than when I saw it for the first time. I'm typing on his computer-wow, I finally went to the next line-because my laptop has seen nothing but endless problems from when I first got it. My fingers are feeling numb while typing- he keeps it so cold in here. He's gone to run errands for a couple of hours so this felt like the perfect time to work on this assignment. Psychology has always interested me. I went to visit TCU and sat in on a psychology class and never before had a class interested me as much as this one did. Actually, I think it was at Hendrix. I couldn't stop talking to my mom about it. But that's not really the field I want to go into. I really want to go into early-childhood education. While in that class, the professor showed a film of schizophrenia where one example was a woman who, in one stage of her mind, became an infant and when she cried, the whole class was shocked by how much she actually sounded like a baby. I have no regret that I choose UT. I love Austin and I'm not the kind of person to let 500-people classes  bother me. I can't  help but feel like while writing this I should focus more on my emotions or something- glancing back over this I realize how boring this is and I apologize to the reader. It doesn't seem to me that my thoughts are usually this shallow and simple but then again, when I'm thinking to myself, my thoughts are not usually this clear-cut. They're usually one huge mass of ideas and vibes I receive from my surroundings. Well, once again I think I've gone a bit over my time limit so I'll stop now. I'm glad this is graded on completion and not depth. \"),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Because the system you use is expensive, inefficient, and open to exploitation. Those are pretty much the reasons why anything becomes expensive. I think the biggest issue is that it\\'s all being run for profit, not for the benefit of the population.,The US healthcare system is a frankenstinian hodge podge of free market and regulations that makes it, in many ways, worse off than either a (mostly) free market solution or a purely socialized system. Markets are efficient because consumers choose to spend based on their preferences and producers produce at a level that is profitable. Those whole supply and demand curves you so often see. BUT the way insurance works in the US means that consumers don\\'t face the full price of medical services they get when they\\'re making the decision, they pay a fraction of the actual cost, often a flat cost by way of a copay or deductable, and then a percentage after that. So consumers buy medical services as if they were much cheaper than they actually are, but producers provide services at a much higher cost than consumers realize they are paying. Fundamentally, insurance works by paying the expected of the insurance payout: I have a ship worth 50,000,000 dollars, and there is a 0.1 chance that it will sink on a trip across the Atlantic, so I pay Lloyd\\'s of London (50,000,000 x 0.001) 50,000 to ensure it. BUT health insurance doesn\\'t work this way, it doesn\\'t just cover rare and unexpected events but it also pays for regular, planned events like normal office visits and delivering a baby. If the probability of something happening is 100, the cost of insuring that is 100 of the price. Insurance companies, however, are required by law to cover a ton of these perfectly expected costs, so the cost of insurance rises. American health insurance is more like a combination insurance and prepaid expense plan, and the resources required by the \"prepaid\" part means the \"insurance\" part is less effective. That\\'s how you end up getting 20 copays for 100 office visits, and go bankrupt if you get cancer. On the provider side, the American Medical Association licenses doctors, and their requirements have a few impacts: They limit the number of doctors licensed by limiting the number of residencies available. Simply put, if we had more residency slots available, we would have more doctors and therefore have lower costs. They ban advertising by doctors. They enforce this ban by limiting access to hospitals, so doctors who require access to hospitals are more strictly affected by this ban than doctors who require little or no access. This prevents price competition among doctors, which prevents the market from lowering prices the way it does in every other service and product. The great example of this is to look at Lasik surgery: It\\'s performed by specialists who have no need for hospital access at all. It\\'s also not covered by most insurance policies. As a result, you see 1.) Price based advertising, and 2.) Consistantly increasing quality coupled with decreasing costs. So the most profit driven procedure in medicine is the only procedure that is cheaper now than it was 10 years ago. That\\'s just a few of the highlights of the problem with the US medical market. It would probably be cheaper if it went one way or the other, either far less regulated and more competetive and profit driven, allowing competition to bring down prices. Or more socialized where the government externally imposes price controls. Both of these have their own problems: Free market means that some people trade off the quality of care for the price of care the same way some people buy used cars and others buy Lamborghini. Socialized requires resources to be allocated somehow, and that somehow is by government agencies. The same kind of government agencies who have brought the Veteran\\'s Administration medical system to us. Both are still probably better than what we have now, though.'),\n",

       " Document(page_content='TOPIC : AS WELL AS MAKING MONEY, BUSINESSES ALSO HAVE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES. DO YOU AGREE OR DISAGREE  \\n  \\n## business and social responsibility\\n\\n  \\n  \\nThere is a spreading belief that besides making money, whether enterprises should also have public responsibilities or not is becoming a controversial question. In my opinion, I agree that while generating profits is a top priority, companies also need to conduct their business in a socially responsible manner.  \\n  \\nOn the one hand, the effort of companies to maximize their profits brings some benefits in a whole society. Firstly, the higher money earned by enterprises, the more taxes that they pay to governments. As a result, authorities can spend those taxes on constructing hospitals or schools, therefore enhancing the living standards for citizens. Secondly, by earning huge profits, enterprises have a chance to develop their production and create for people more job opportunities, which can lessen the unemployment rate in their countries.  \\n  \\nOn the other hand, there are essential reasons explaining why enterprises have to accept their social responsibilities to the common community. The first reason is that their activities have an effect on the environment. Without controls, their productions will cause some serious environmental degradation, such as global warming stemming from the factory emissions or irresponsible waste disposal. For example, if companies install waste treatment system instead of discharging the industrial wastes into rivers, the pollution can be limited and controlled. Another reason is that big corporations should help other small enterprises because they have enough money to do so. To more clarify, Vinamilk - which is a reputable corporation that improving their public image to consumers by philanthropic actions such as providing scholarships and giving the charitable donations.  \\n  \\nIn conclusion, although making money is a fundamental principle of every business, however, I would argue that they should have a profound understanding of their social responsibilities.  \\n  \\nThanks for all your help.'),\n",

Determined to help myself overcome chronic stage fright, I knew the club was the perfect opportunity to help me speak comfortably in front of people. However, I was apprehensive about the club. It is common for all children to be nervous when it comes to encountering new experiences, but multiply that anxiety times ten for me. When my junior year of high school arrived, I was booted out of my nest of comfort into something quite uncomfortable called \"public speaking.\" I thought I would not survive my new setting, that is, until a few months later when I came across the word \"Toastmasters\" in a flyer at my home. As a member of a speaking program called the Toastmasters International Club, the world\\'s number one public speaking club, my dad developed a local, after school six-week Toastmasters Youth Leadership Program at my brother\\'s middle school to help students who have speech deficiencies. I was stunned toward this opportunity shown right in front of my eyes. The force to pull me out of my comfort zone was too much to resist. For countless days, I reminisced over how I had spent my past life in school living in fear of standing in front of crowds of people. It\\'s true. Like King George VI shying away from the microphone, I also had a habit of constantly isolating myself whenever I was confronted with a public speaking opportunity. I realized it was time for me to accept my fear. Attempting to successfully complete my college studies would prove to be more challenging than necessary if I were not to conquer my fear of public speaking. The first day at the club was nerve-racking. To make matters worse, I had to record myself on camera each week so that I could look at myself after oral presentations. Being forced to look at myself on video every week was excruciating, but I thought of it as a benefit for me to improve. As a result of my club efforts, every participation activity and oral presentation in English class grew less painful and more enjoyable. The agony I had experienced in my Toastmasters \"trials\" was transformed into the confidence I had lacked for years. Joining the Toastmasters club has awakened an urge inside me that I had never felt. I suddenly want to express myself as freely as possible and accept \"speaking\" as a friend rather than as an enemy. I want to apply my newly gained learning experience to succeed in college studies and my passion in becoming a dentist. Furthermore, I found out dentistry is not just fixing teeth and using tools, rather speaking is the most important due to establishing important relationships between dentist and patient.'),\n",

Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students would be assigned homework, classwork, quizzes, and tests all from an online instructor. Instead of learning in a normal classroom setting, students would watch videos of their teacher or read online notes. If students attended every class at home it would not be beneficial because students who were less indpendent may slack off and they wouldn't be exposed to the social factors that come from attending a regular school.\\n\\nMany students struggle to pay attention in class or they do not have a very strong work ethic so it's important that they have a teacher there to push them. If they were given the opportunity to attend classes through a computer screen their bad habits may become worse. At home students can be distracted by other screens, younger siblings, pets, and many other things. Attending a normal school limits the amount of distractions a student would face at home. When a student begins to lose focus a teacher is there to remind them to finish their work. However, at home the student may not have someone hovering over their shoulder to make sure that they are absorbing the content.\\n\\nAlso, online schoolong limits the amount of exposure students would have to social situations. In elementary school, students learn more than just spelling and fractions but social skills as well. If a first grader were to take classes online they wouldn't understand how to raise their hand, wait their turn, or share their markers because it would be just them and a screen. In middle school, students would miss out on navigating busy hallways and playing a sport for their school. In high school, they wouldn't be able to participate in honor societies, clubs, or hands on classes. Many students take architecture, film, art, and agriculture classes to discover what they want to do after high school. However, each of these classes require hands on, expensive equipment that most students wouldn't have at home. Online schooling would limit the type of classes a student could take. In addition, many exploratory classes require students to work in teams to solve problems and work on projects. Online schooling would hinder a student's ability to work collaboratively.\\n\\nSome may argue that online schooling is a better option for students who like to work at their own pace. Some students take a longer time to digest content than others so having their classes online would allow them to spend more time on areas that they struggle with. In a classroom setting, if a single student was struggling but the rest of the class understood the teacher would likely move on. In the same way, online schooling would allow students who move at a faster pace to breeze through material that comes naturally to them. Overall, online schooling would allow students to tailor the pace of their classes to what benefits them best.\\n\\nIn conclusion, online schooling may prevent students from finishing their work and learning the necessary social skills however it would allow them to work at their own pace. Students who are less driven may fall behind in their work because online schooling wouldn't provide any reprecussions. Additionally, students wouldn't benefity from the social situations that come from attending a regular school. Lastly, students would be able to determine the pace of their classes instead of relying on the levels of the students surrounding them in a classroom setting. Online schooling has some benefits however attending a regular school would be more beneficial especially during the developmental stages of a child's life.\\xa0\"),\n",

I say this because say in sports you have to have a team right, and together you win, travel, and do other things. Also you have to plan, so there includes talking and you get to know everyone there. Having new friends would probably mean that you can be able to reach for another goal.\\n\\nDoing extracurricular activities can help you want to do better in school because you have a new occupation and maybe you like the new activity you\\'re doing but it requires you to have good grades.

Therefore, there should be some changes for voting.\\n\\nTo continue, election of presidents by popular vote should be used in the United States. If we are voting for presidents, then why should us ,citizens, vote for electors in order for them to vote for our president?

Because of the winnertakeall system in each state,candidates don\\'t spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the \"swing\"states.\" In addition, it states in source 3 \"In defense of the Electoral College\",\" No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president.\" This shows that with the Electoral College, not every region is going to have electoral votes. Therefore, it would not be fair for those regions. Perhaps their votes would not count and basically the chosen president would not pay attention to them.\\n\\nFurthermore, everyone should be allowed to vote not just citizens. The fact that not everybody are qualified citizens to vote, then the amount of votes would be vague. This process is similar to not having enough electoral votes. The votes would not be popular or in a great amount for that specific place. For example, as it mentions in source 3, \"Voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaignto really listen to the competing candidatesknowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average...\" There should not be any thoughtful voters deciding on the election. It makes it unfair for those who want to vote but are not allowed.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Electoral College could have benefits. In this process it is easier for the electors who are voting. If there is a tie in votes, then they can pass it on to the House of Representatives in which state delegations take care of the voting. At least with this process, they have their own system set up and if any problems, they know in what way it can be fixed. Unlike voting by popular vote, it can cause some problems because not everyone is allowed to vote and there could be few votes for candidates which would have a negative outcome. However, it would be the same for the Electoral College because there would be not enough electors in regions.\\n\\nIn conclusion, election by popular vote for the president of the United States should be used.

Obviously, too little weight on the front is as bad as too much, but up to a point, reducing front weight bias is good. This reduces forward forces on the wheels and allows them to pull the car to the side more, in car-guy (or -girl) terms, it reduces understeer. When going around a turn, the rear end of the car is the most de-stabilized part of the vehicle, and shifting weight to the rear compresses the rear suspension. This sounds bad, but it\\'s actually good, because compressed suspension is stable suspension, and behaves in a far more orderly manner than suspension that is allowed to wildly flail up and down. In short, it does a better job of keeping the wheels in solid contact with the tarmac, which is the whole job of suspension to begin with.

This is a phenomenon I\\'m not as well-versed in as the ones above, but I can tell you from experience that a RWD car definitely likes to go around corners faster and more smoothly than a FWD car.

What I am disputing is the phenomenon of dismissing a common belief or behavior as \"just a social construct,\" as if social constructs are totally arbitrary and have no deeper significance. My position is that these constructs must necessarily have arisen out of natural factors, and that those natural factors are still around today. My reasoning for this is that social influence could not always have been in play; hundreds of thousands of years ago there was no such thing as language and thus \"social constructs\" could not exist. My idea is that once language developed, the first and most enduring social constructs grew out of instinctual behavior. Further (though my knowledge of genetics is admittedly limited) I believe the scientific consensus is that genetics (nature) tend to have more bearing on individual behavior than social context or upbringing (nurture). If this is true, a given \"social construct\" could only attain widespread prevalence if it appealed to something inherent in the physical makeup of a large group of humans. And for the record - by no means am I implying that just because a behavior is \"natural\" it is acceptable.

The author believes that regulations made throughout government entities can influence public health. He proposes that policies, plans, and projects be evaluated with recommendations for healthier choices. Some issues that could facilitate further review include minimum wage requirements, utility assistance for low-income families, and additional regulation on air quality and land use (Wernham, 2011).\\n\\nThere are many environmental aspects that can affect the health of citizens. How the roads are designed and maintained can affect the cost of fuel and the amount of wear and tear on a vehicle. Highways can add excessive air and noise pollution. The location of businesses and power plants can affect the food supply, air quality, and natural resources of the area. Even the condition or lack of sidewalks can be a safety concern (Wernham, 2011).\\n\\nThe author뗩 desire is to warn the reader about the monetary costs and health implications of ignoring the environmental impacts on health. Poverty influences health; it leads to such problems as obesity, malnutrition, cardiovascular disease, mental health disorders, and diabetes. Financial assistance can alleviate some of this risk. Poor air quality increases the likelihood of asthma and cancer. The noise and pollution from highways can also affect respiratory function and well-being. If people are able to live in safe and clean areas and eat healthy food, they will have a greater chance of success. If pollutants are placed away from people and food sources, the people will not be subject to the potential side effects as easily. The location and condition of parks and sidewalks can reduce physical injury and encourage exercise; both are good for continued health (Wernham, 2011).\\n\\nThe author believes that the reward of health outweighs the potential monetary cost. At this point, the cost and convenience for a business are the biggest inhibitors. Rightfully, there will be the added cost of evaluation, training, and alterations. However, the health of the people is more important than the bottom line. In response to monetary concerns, the author proposes the introduction of laws and regulations to make everyone equally accountable. The author also proposes the need for funding sources. The cost of safety should never be an excuse (Wernham, 2011).\\n\\nSome businesses and companies are already taking the initiative to create a healthy nation. In one instance, an apartment complex for the elderly was to be built near a highway. There was concern about the noise and pollution, especially for those individuals with pre-existing health conditions. The builders added a garden area to buffer the excess sound and altered the air intake vents to face away from the highway. These were two easy solutions to the problem. In another situation, a plan to lease fuel from Alaska was proposed. There was a fear that the food source would be destroyed. Everyone worked together to ensure that a portion of preserved land be maintained and protected (Wernham, 2011).\\n\\nThere are ways to make people happy and healthy in the environment. The health of America is dependent upon the actions, laws, and guidelines set in government.

       " Document(page_content='The playback device employs a technique called interpolation. This normally happens even when a 50x50 movie is displayed on a 100x100 monitor as well. In the simplest form, when a new pixel needs to be made, the computer (or whatever you use) looks at the surrounding pixels, and generates a pixel that has the average color of the ones around it. This however would look a bit ugly if it just inserted an uneven amount of pixels here and there. It\\'s however no problem to create an algorithm that deals with several pixels. If a computer wants to interpolate a 1x2 \"image\" consisting of a red and a blue pixel up to a 1x3 image, it knows that the first pixel will be 100 red, the second pixel will be 50 red and 50 blue, and the last pixel will be 100 blue. If you have a situation with 3 pixels being interpolated to 4. Let\\'s say red green and blue, the computer calculates that the first will be 100 red, the second pixel will be 50 red and 50 green, the 3rd will be 50 green and 50 blue, the last pixel will be 100 blue. As you can see, the \"pure green\" pixel no longer gets represented as pure green. With this strong color changes and so few pixels, you get a significant degradation in image quality, but this effect is lessened the more pixels an image has, as the computer gets more data points to generate color from. Doing this to a 70x70 going to 100x100 is the same, except instead of going from 3 to 4, you go from 7 to 10, and in two dimensions instead of one. You\\'ll get some percentages that don\\'t add up, but the computer just rounds them off. The inaccuracies from rounding them off won\\'t be noticable to human eyes anyway. This happens even if you have a 2x2 image going to 4x4. You don\\'t just get 4 points of color that now take up 4 pixels. The additional pixels are also interpolated, so you get gradient colors in between the 4 original pixels. It doesn\\'t really matter that you\\'re doing it with an uneven number of pixels, as the computer can handle hundreds of varying intensities of color, and will usually be able to find an appropriate color to fill the nexw pixels with. If one of the original pixels land on the \"border\" of two new pixels, you kinda lose the \"pure\" color of that pixel, and instead get two new pixels that each have part of the original\\'s pixel\\'s color. This is why images that are slightly off-resolution become much fuzzier, especially if they have clean lines with lots of contrast. There are many types of interpolation. Each interpolation algorithm (a fancy word for a complex mathematical function used to calculate things) calculates the values for additional pictures differently, leading to different results. Some methods are better at guessing new pixel colors than others, but may consume more processing power (a big deal if a low-power device needs to perform this operation 24 times (or more) a second). Some algorithms make better results when shrinking images, others may make better results when magnifying them.'),\n",

According to McConnell and Brue (2005), the workforce, in this case, is usually persons aged 18-65. Children, students and senior citizens are not involved in this. In most cases, there is always a given number of individuals not employed due to various reasons such as sickness, switching jobs etc hence the classification of unemployment into frictional, structural cyclical among others. Economists recommend an unemployment level of 4% for an economy to function well.\\n\\nInflation is often defined as the general increase in the price level in an economy. McConnell however dispute this explanation and say that inflation is the excess supply of money in an economy with an increase in the general price level being the most obvious sign.\\n\\nGDP as a summation of all the economic activities in an economy is often regarded as the most reliable indicator of the performance of an economy through its suitability has of late been challenged as it rarely captures the real change in social welfare of the people (Thornhill, 2009). Unfortunately, these figures might be flawed as a result of inflation and hence the need to change the figure from its nominal form to real form by adjusting it to inflation to obtain real GDP.\\n\\nThe real GDP growth rate in Jordan\\n\\nBefore the credit crunch hit the global economy, the country was growing at a steady rate. This was mainly fueled by its solid and steady manufacturing economy based on phosphates and potash reserves in the making of fertilizers. Growth is also attributed to closer ties with the western world thus more foreign investments in the country. Such developments plus a growing IT sector are creating valuable employment opportunities thereby reducing unemployment levels.\\n\\nUnemployment rates in Jordan, Syria, Israel and Saudi Arabia.\\n\\nHuman development index.\\n\\nN.B. values given correspond to the year뗩 figures used and not the release date (e.g. 2006 HDI was released in 2008 using figures in the 2006 financial year)\\n\\nAs earlier said, the stance taken by Jordan in embracing western relations has been responsible for turning the fortunes of the country around. More western companies are investing in the growing economy as a foot ground for more developments in the Middle East and the larger Arab Asia. Again the government has relaxed the Islam culture that in one way or another promotes gender inequality. As a result, there has been higher female enrolment in schools and even more women participating in the labour force thus driving the economy further into prosperity.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nJordan GDP  real growth rate .\\n\\nList of countries by Human Development Index.

       " Document(page_content='The essay asked you to deliver an extent or measured agreement or disagreement with the given topic. Based on your first paragraph, it appears that you disagree with the idea of government subsidized transport. However, you neglected to clearly respond to the question posed. Then upon reading the reasoning paragraphs, you used the comparative discussion for the presentation. These are the 3 main reasons why your essay does not meet the requirements for a passing score based on the prompt requirements.  \\n  \\nThe measured response (ex. I strongly, I totally, I wholly, I primarily) is the personal point of view that will establish your response to the question and also, identify the discussion slant of the essay. That is, to support only one side of the discussion, proving your assertions within 2 related, coherent, and cohesive paragraphs. The minute you used the comparative essay format, you went against the expected discussion format. When you did not indicate a measured response, you changed the prompt discussion instruction. Both errors will not only pull down you overall score, but result in the failing score of your essay.  \\n  \\nSo what is the format for this discussion? This is a 4 paragraph essay utilizing 3-5 sentences per paragraph so it should go something like this:  \\n  \\nPar. 1: Prompt paraphrase with response: There has been some deliberation regarding having the state wholly subsidize the national transit system. The question posed is \"would the total gratuity be a good move in resolving the road gridlock problem?\". My response to this inquiry is this, I am in total opposition to the idea. A total free transport system is not the solution to the problem.  \\n  \\nPar. 2: Offer a single reason to support your claim. Use your personal observation or opinion. Do not refer to research results or anything of the sort. The essay relies on your personal knowledge, observation, and experience for its discussion presentation.  \\n  \\nPar. 3: Offer a solid example of why your reason is correct. A single reason is all that is needed because you are defending your opinion with supporting examples. You are not writing a comparative essay. The direct opinion question is never responded to as a comparative essay discussion.  \\n  \\nPar. 4: Recap the first 3 discussion point. The topic, your opinion, and your example. Then use a closing sentence to end the essay. The last paragraph is just meant to summarize the discussion and that is all you have to do. Show that you can restate your discussion points effectively to bring the essay full circle.  \\n  \\nRemember, read the instructions. Figure out what the discussion format should be first and write the essay in the expected format. That way you can be sure of meeting all the task and writing requirements. While you might make some grammar mistakes, if you follow the format I suggest above, your essay should reach at least a 5 band score.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Hellenization and Its Affects on the birth and spread of Christianity Report\\n\\nWhat is Hellenization?\\n\\nHellenization is a term that is commonly used in describing the spread of the culture of the ancient Greeks as well as, to a smaller degree, the Greek language in particular. This issue includes the indication of the rate at which the culture spread was the highest among all the foreign nations conquered by Greece or within its sphere of influence.\\n\\nIt is worth noting that Alexander the Great is the historical figure who can be largely linked to the spread of Hellenization. His contribution to the development and promotion of the Greek culture and language is done through his conquests of the new lands and other cultures, thus enabling the spread of Hellenization within the period of his life, which was the fourth century BC (Eraman 34). The whole concept of this is what has been referred to as Hellenism, a study of ancient Greece, in modern days.\\n\\nIn what ways do you think it might have affected the birth and spread of Christianity?\\n\\nAs it is evident from most of the scholarly articles studying and examining Greek philosophy, Hellenism was a cultural force that significantly affected many lands and countries within the Mediterranean region.\\n\\nFurthermore, basing on the fact that Christianity arose, developed and received a wide spread in the countries along the Mediterranean area, there are a lot of reasons to believe that Hellenism contributed much to its growth and consequent spread. In his book, Brief Introduction to the New Testament, Bart Ehrman (45) argues that the majority of the early Christians insisted on borrowing some ideas from the Greek cultural world as well as church terms are derived from the Greek language.\\n\\nThe factors that made the early Christians address to the Greek culture and language may be explained in the following way. In order to help the first missionaries communicate and spread the gospel to those who surround them, they decided to use the language that would be understood by a wide majority of people who may be viewed as a future congregation of a new developing religion. Moreover, to attract more church members, the early Christians used to implement some views and ideas of Greek culture to their propagation.\\n\\nThus, they made the alien religion become closer and more understandable to the people with the Greek influenced vision of life. As such, Hellenistic ideologies gradually infiltrated into the Christian setting. As a matter of fact, Bart Erman argues that the outstanding and well-known Greek philosophers, such as Plato, Aristotle, as well as some others, greatly influenced on as well as remarkably contributed to the development of the ideologies that are represented in the New Testament (78).\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nEhrman, Bart.

       " Document(page_content='UPS and Home Depot Companies Logistics Value Generation Essay\\n\\nLogistics Value Generation is an essential feature of the functioning of any company that wants to achieve success in a specific sphere. Close attention to its five areas contributes to the organization뗩 prosperity. United Parcel Service (UPS) and Home Depot are well-known American companies that have acquired popularity among thousands of customers. Comparing peculiarities of the Logistics Value Generation of these organizations can help understand why they are quite successful.\\n\\nThe first area of Logistics Value Generation is order processing. Both these companies closely focus on this point and strive to provide their customer with fast processing of their orders. As for similarities, although these organizations get thousands of orders, they work rapidly and qualitatively to keep all clients. In addition, customers can make their order via the organizations online system and be sure that they will be able to obtain the chosen products without delays. However, contrary to UPS, Home Depot also allows its clients to make the orders in the store. Thus, this part of the Logistics Value Generation is efficiently functioning.\\n\\nAs for the second area, inventory, these organizations utilize all their resources to ensure that their clients are completely satisfied with the companies work and can find all the products they need. Both firms have integrated systems that provide the delivery of goods without any delays and distribution centers where the products are held. In these centers, the workers control the temperature and air humidity. Therefore, UPS and Home Depot have proper inventory management and allow clients to know what products are in stock.\\n\\nThe third area, transportation, is represented by the wide range of vehicles. As for similarities, the companies offer their customers all transportation services for the delivery of their goods. As for differences, while Home Depot rent their vehicles to customers, UPS has a carrier-neutral platform that manages the distribution and transportation of goods. Hence, the organizations have chosen different but effective ways to help clients avoid any problems with delivery.\\n\\nAs for the fourth area, warehousing, materials handling, and packaging, the organizations have various facilities and equipment. They also pay attention to the materials of the packing. However, while UPS focuses on ecological safety and brand, Home Depot strives to create wrapping, due to which store employees can quickly identify the product and the address of its delivery. Thus, the companies work not only on the goods but also on their packing.\\n\\nThe facility networks of the organizations are represented by many facilities, where employees try to provide communication between distribution centers and installers. It seems the network of Home Depot is developed more quality since many people control the delivery of products and check their location. However, simultaneously, the workers of UPS call their packages their patients that need to be taken care of and helped to get to new owners. The companies strive to provide all necessary conditions to avoid any problems that may occur with their goods.\\n\\nAfter comparing and contrasting of Logistics Value Generation, represented by five areas, of UPS and Home Depot, it can be concluded that both companies care about their products and customers. Although some minor differences between them show that one organization is slightly better in one sphere, while another is more developed in others, these companies are attentive to all the details of their functioning. Therefore, it would be wrong to claim that one company is much better and more successful than another.\\n'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='How is the election of the president of the U.S.? The election is base on two parts, the first one is the Electoral College and the second one is the popular vote or the vote of the people. Changing to the election by popular vote would be a great idea because the president of the U.S. would be loved and accepted for most of the of the people in United States and it less complicated than the Electoral vote that can create a big mess.\\n\\nAccording to the beginning of the U.S. Constitution ,\\'\\'We the people of the United States of America...\", it shows that the people have the right to change the government. When we select someone to be our leader we are selecting someone according to their values and to their actions before being the leader, but we are not selecting someone according to his political view-democrat or republican-. In the Electoral college what they basically due is vote for the president who have the same political view as they have and if that person is going to help them in the future as president. So the Electoral College means business, while the popular vote select the president according to what is he going to do with the country. Also the 358 electors cannot represent the whole population of the United States, so basically they are not having a democratic system where everyone have a right. For example in 2000 when the elction between Bush and Gore, Gore won the popular vote while Bush won the Electoral vote letting Bush won the precidency.\\xa0 After Bush won the precidency, he began sending soldiers to Afghanistan and Irac separating millions of U.S families, so the meaning is that people were right that Brush was not going to be a good president since the beginning, but at the end it was the fault of the Electoral College. Sometimes the Electoral College make a well political decision and could problaby help more the government, while the people were just selecting someone that was going to destroy the government.\\n\\nThe popular vote is less complicated than the Electoral college where they have sometimes ties and controversies. Ther Electoral College sometimes is unfair against the popular, for example in Florida have 29 electoral votes while Wyoming have only 3 electoral votes is not fair to compare the two of them. The popular vote is easier, must of the times there are no ties so it woukld make it easy to select the president. In the other hand the popular vote would get really tie and one of the person that is running for president would ask for a recount of the vote, so it would take longer to select the president. Aslo if is there a tie in the Electoral College the election would be thrown at the House of Representative and giving the Senate the opportunity to select the president, leading to more complexity for choosing a president.\\n\\nAt the end the popular vote means the people\\'s vote and a fair election. Voting for the president of the United States is not an easy way, but as you read in the eassay you would see that the popular vote get the highest point for being the easiest one. Having a country that select their own president means that the countruy would accept anything that the precident is doing.    '),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Non-Rigid Structure from Motion (NRSfM) refers to the problem of reconstructing cameras and the 3D point cloud of a non-rigid object from an ensemble of images with 2D correspondences. Current NRSfM algorithms are limited from two perspectives: (i) the number of images, and (ii) the type of shape variability they can handle. These difficulties stem from the inherent conflict between the condition of the system and the degrees of freedom needing to be modeled - which has hampered its practical utility for many applications within vision. In this paper we propose a novel hierarchical sparse coding model for NRSFM which can overcome (i) and (ii) to such an extent, that NRSFM can be applied to problems in vision previously thought too ill posed. Our approach is realized in practice as the training of an unsupervised deep neural network (DNN) auto-encoder with a unique architecture that is able to disentangle pose from 3D structure. Using modern deep learning computational platforms allows us to solve NRSfM problems at an unprecedented scale and shape complexity. Our approach has no 3D supervision, relying solely on 2D point correspondences. Further, our approach is also able to handle missingoccluded 2D points without the need for matrix completion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the impressive performance of our approach where we exhibit superior precision and robustness against all available state-of-the-art works in some instances by an order of magnitude. We further propose a new quality measure (based on the network weights) which circumvents the need for 3D ground-truth to ascertain the confidence we have in the reconstructability. We believe our work to be a significant advance over state-of-the-art in NRSFM.'),\n",

According to the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\", before 2000, a rover was \" device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars\". Now, humans are trying to create cars that does not need a driver. Though technology has gone far, it has not gone far enough to accomplish such a feat.\\n\\nThe main issue with driverless cars is safety. Though there are numerous sensors surrounding the car and the driver is notified when they need to take control, there still isnt enough for a car to work on its own. Even if the car reached the technological point to ensure the safety of the passengers, another large safety concern would be other drivers on the road. Yes, the driverless car can sense when it is about to ensue a collision, it does not have the capability to avoid it, just lik any other car. So, as a human, I would rather trust myself for my safety over technology.\\n\\nWhen it comes to the law, texting and drinking while driving is illegal. If driverless cars were created and used, humans would be breaking two laws that harm drivers the most. Yes, the driver will be notified when they are in need by lights and a vibrating seat, but if they are under the influence they will not be able to anyways. If they are distracted in any way by texting, food, etc. then they will not be in a ready situation to take control of the vehicle. AS a driver, it would be nice to sleep and the driverless car would allow that, but that would be just as dangerous as sleeping behind the wheel in a regular car. The driver would not be ready to take the wheel or they would not even notice when they are in need to take the wheel. Creating a heads up display would add to this distraction and would take on the role of texting and driving.\\n\\nThough there are many negatives, the reader understands that there are positives. Using less gas would be extremely nice and would help economy. If driverless cars got to the point where it was only public and no one bought cars, then money would be saved by all. And, with the sensors, the car can drive very well on its own and it is at a very good point right now.\\n\\nWith the positives, though, it is not enough for the driverless car to save someone\\'s life. It does not have the technology to avoid other drivers. And, driverless cars will never cancel the use of regular cars because not everyone will trust them. Driverless cars will create controversy, just as the passage brought up \"Whose fault is it in an accident? The cars or the drivers?\" Though driverless cars have come a long way and have very good ideas, they need much more work before they can be trustable.      '),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.Some people believe that educational facilities must accept the same numbers of men as women in every subject. There are both pros and cons in this argument, which will be discussed in this essay.\\nA tremendous number of people think that equality is crucial for education. Nowadays, more and more activists fight for women's rights. They want that every female can study everything that she prefers, notwithstanding this is socially acceptable or not. Moreover, many feminists suggest that patriarchal societies do not allow women to study equality with men. For example, when a little boy says to his younger sister that she is not intelligent enough for the men's play, a little girl grows up and thinks that she cannot study men's subjects and work men's jobs. Therefore, the main reason to accept equal numbers of both sexes is to crush many stereotypes about women's intellectual abilities and allow them to choose which subject they really want to study.\\nOn the other hand, some people can complain that this is discrimination against men. For instance, if every university will accept only 50% of men with the highest grades in every subject, men with average grades but higher than women's will not be accepted. Furthermore, this idea does not guarantee that all wise women will study in universities. Females also can do not want to learn every existing subject.\\nIn conclusion, the main point of equality in education is about choice, not coercion. From my point of view, that would be great if male and female students could study the same subjects; if more boys prefer to be teachers, while more girls like to be scientists. However, this is impossible when a lot of stereotypes exist, and the coercion of universities to accept balanced numbers of students based on their genders does not help solve the global issue with equality.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Election by popular vote would be a much better system because Electoral Collge can be unpredictable and is an unfair method of voting for voters.\\n\\nTo begin, The Electoral College isn\\'t always predictable. In the article\\n\\nDoes the Electoral College Work states \"laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilites are.\" This shows that Electors from every state may not be chosen correctly or by trustworthy sources. These Electors may also have different requirements to do their job or how to become an elector, so states will may have diffrent respones from their electors. Another example of this is shown in\\n\\nThe Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong which states \"Electors could always defy the will of the people.\" This demostartes that the people who vote for these electors can easily be betrayed by the people they voted for. At any point of time these electors that should be voting for the candidate they are chosen to can change their mind and vote for whomever they please. Clearly, the electors for the Electoral College can be unpredictable and by the time are chosen it may be too late this is why we must change to popular vote.\\n\\nIn Adddition, The Electoral College is an unfair method of voting for voters. In the article\\n\\nThe indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong it states \"Candidates don\\'t spend time in states they know they have no chance winning.\" This shows that candidates aren\\'t even going to certain states because they believe the Electoral College points won\\'t be given to them. This is unfair to voters because they can\\'t even make a proper decison on the president because they may only see one candidate. So this entire state is not fully informed on the election and may chose the wrong candidate when there may be one that shares more of their beliefs in the election. Futhermore, in the article\\n\\nIn Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep ur despised method of choosing the President it states \"The Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state.\" This explains that potential voters may not vote because they know that candidate will most likely not win for their state. Depending on what type of people there are in that region (race, religion, political point of view) they may not vote on a certain candidate. So most voters know their one vote probably wouldn\\'t make a diffrence. If we had popular vote everyone would have say in who is chosen for our president.\\n\\nTo conclude, We should change to popular vote because by using the Electoral College we allow unpredictable people to vote for entire states and inable voters to have an unfair election.    \\xa0    '),\n",

These things shows that the candidates dont care about having the smaller states votes, but wants bigger populated states like california and texas. This is often called a '' Winner-take-all'' system since it each state doesn't get to see what there elector is really all about. Also it can show\\xa0 that with the electoral college, electors can vote for a president who is regionally favorable and not nationaly. This can often make the voters feel less satisfied with thier president since there president might not show intrest in there opinions.\\n\\nThe Electoral college also avoids the problem of elections in which there is little\\xa0 to no popular votes what so ever. Nixon in 1968 and clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes,while winning a majority in the Electoral College (sourse 3: paragraph 22).This goes to show that the Peoples votes dont usually matter when it comes to voting for a president but the electors do.\\n\\nOnce agian,The senate should remove the Electoral college and make the popular vote system the main way of deciding who's president.

If it had to do it for every pixel, it would push computations very high, dropping your framerate dramatically. To make it faster, the card could remember that computed image as a bitmap and keep it for just the single frame or remember it for the time it\\'s being used. In either case, there is still the overhead of making that rasterized image, x 3 or more for every image type (diffuse, specular, normal, metallic, emission, etc) and for each element on the screen (barrel\\'s texture set, gun\\'s texture set, vehicle\\'s texture set, terrain, etc). That requires a lot of memory and puts computation time up as well (every single SVG has to be converted first, remember). Your 60 fps game will drop dramatically when this has to happen, such as every time a new unit comes on screen or a new special effect triggers, or you have to have enough memory to store all of that generated data on top of the initial SVG. Game design strives to use as few clock cycles per frame as possible and use a graphics card\\'s memory as efficiently as possible. An SVG requires more clock cycles than a bitmap or more memory than conventional bitmaps, so we just cut out the middle man and generate a bitmap instead. Anecdotally, the \"game loading\" process also optimizes the existing bitmaps into a more efficient format and laid out in the graphics card\\'s memory as tightly as possible and could use SVGs to source that data for that process, but at the expense of longer load times.'),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"In today's society, many people agree that having a simple goal and achieving it is better than having a huge goal and failing to achieve it, but i disagree. One of the greatest artists, Michelangelo, said that setting our aim too low and achieving it is a great danger for some of us. He stated this thought because he failed and made mistakes before he was known as a great artist. Michelangelo rather fail by doing something big than his life than doing something small and achieving it. I agree with Michelangelo because you learn from past mistakes, you learn to take risks, and having bigger goals help you improve ones self.\\n\\nMichelangelo is a great artist because of his work, but he learned from his own work to keep moving forward. People can learn from past mistakes by seeing what went wrong and practice doing better at it; for example, in a show called\\n\\nMasterchef, chefs must impress the judges by their skills in cooking but one chef gets eliminated every episode. When a chef gets eliminated their dreams may get crushed, but they had the courage to go on and did their best and can learn what they did wrong. Another example is taking the permit test as a teenager. The permit test is something big for teens since it is something related to their future. When I took the test I was nervous and failed by one question, but i checked the answers I got wrong and studied them a bit more and passed the next time I took it. These examples prove that you have the ability to learn from past mistakes, grow as a person, and that you might have to take risks in doing so.\\n\\nTaking risks are mostly involved in big decisions that involve jobs, education,etc. I believe that taking risks are better than small decisions even if those risks don't turn out the way you wanted them too. In a show called Shark Tank, people come in to persuade investors to invest in their products, but they do not always succeed. The people who do not get investments keep moving forward and take their own risks to get a investor. If you learn to take risks, you later get use to it and you can speak more in front of people and state your opinion. Another example is having a meeting for a job. It is best to have a meeting in person than online because it is not as easy so you get challenged and the person interviewing can know you better and you can most likely get the position. Taking risks can make you a better person as a whole and those mistakes can help you improve.\\n\\nMichelangelo and I agree that having a bigger goal and failing is better than having a small goal and achieving it. Having a bigger goal can increase your confidence and help you put your head in the task you want to overcome. People view their mistakes and overcome it so they can do better next time. Small goals do not involve much effort and work as bigger achievements; by choosing to accomplish a simple task, you as a person may get use to the easy way out and can get lazy over time. Setting a higher aim for yourself is better because you can improve your skills and knowledge. Bigger goals are better because of how much they help you improve.\\n\\nA great artist once said it is great danger setting a small aim for yourself. Setting a bigger aim and failing is best because you learn from your mistakes, you learn to take risks, and bigger goals help improve ones self. Smaller aims are a scapegoat compared to bigger aims because of how much easier they are. It is best to challenge yourself so that you are ready for anything that comes your way. Even if you take the high route and fail, it does not mean you can try again. In conclusion, setting a bigger aim and failing is alright and better than setting a small aim due to it being more easy.\"),\n",

I told the student that he should studied because, people are not going to be their when he needs to take a test.\\n\\nAnother reason to be successful in this world is that I would never give up, and will always do what even if the people said that I am not going to made it.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?* (At least 250 words - IELTS essay)  \\n  \\n## how to protect our tradition?\\n\\n  \\n  \\nIt has been argued by many that the development of technology has a strong correlation with the extinction of traditional values. Although modern technology and tradition are two contrast values to some extent, the co-existence of the both values should be considered essential.  \\n  \\nThe first reason is that the preservation of traditional values is strongly promoted by the state-of-the-art technology. In fact, cultural heritage of a nation is promoted by the emergence of online platforms. For instance, since the traditional products made by the ethnic minorities in Vietnam have been recently introduced by social media, an increase in the number of tourists who visited Vietnam has been witnessed for the last 5 years. The growing technology, in addition, has contributed to the preservation of traditional values. For illustrative purposes, if the Vietnamese government did not use the advanced technology to undertake the restoration work of Notre Dame Cathedral, the young generation would not have a chance to visit the place in their lifetime.  \\n  \\nSecondly, the co-operation of both traditional values and technology is considered essential for the economic development of any nation. First, by using latest technology, tourism companies are able to generate higher income from tourists in terms of cultural activities and related services. For example, in the era of digital technology, the 3D platform has been applied in numerous activities of cultural experiences, which attracts more customers and generates higher revenue. The application of technology in the preservation of traditional values, moreover, will bring significant benefits for the growth of any industry. There is an increasing trend of using technology in the mass production of traditional products, which increased the quantities of exported goods of Vietnam by 30% in the last 3 years, according to the latest report conducted by Department of High Technology of Vietnam.  \\n  \\nIn conclusion, modern technology and traditional values should exist together because of a variety of aforementioned reasons. The government should undertake strategic plans to protect traditions by using latest forms of technology.  \\n  \\nWord count: 329 words'),\n",

Thus, it is important to understand the objectives of Sougha뗩 IMC campaign to select the right media to deliver messages to the audience. Different media will be used in the next one year.\\n\\nRadio advertising will be adopted to ensure that the organization reaches out to millions of people in the UAE. Radio stations will be used selectively to focus on the different demographics of the region. For example, stations will be adopted based on the language they use to broadcast. It would be meaningless to use a language that would not be understood by the majority of the audience in a certain location.\\n\\nThe time of the day to run advertisements will also be chosen based on the time when most members of the target population will be available. For example, the evening would be preferred in the morning because most people would be free and listen to the radio. The IMC plan would use newspaper advertising, which would encompass placing special adverts on unique pages in major newspapers in the UAE.\\n\\nIt would be essential to advertise on pages that would be dedicated to job opportunities. However, the front and back pages would be ideal for Sougha뗩 IMC campaign. Sponsored phone messaging would be an appropriate way of advertising the activities of the organization. In this context, the firm would collaborate with a leading player in telecommunications, which would spearhead phone messaging. Also, online advertising would be an ideal approach to delivering information. Several online platforms might be used, for example, Facebook and Twitter. Advertisements would be placed on websites that would be characterized by considerable traffic.\\n\\nBudgeting would be considered when implementing the media plan. It would be vital to use the minimum amount of money to execute an effective media plan. Significant funds will be solicited from sponsors and well-wishers.\\n\\nFigure 1. A diagram showing a frequency distribution of Sougha뗩 IMC media plan.\\n\\nIf an advertiser wants to reach a target of 40 people, then approaches that would combine the frequencies would be used. The main aim would be to reach as many people as possible.\\n\\nDemographics\\n\\nDemographics would give important data about a population concerning time. Demographics are used in market research to determine important subsets of a target population. One of the best applicable aspects of demographics that would be important in Sougha뗩 IMC campaign would be age because it would be expected that the majority of the unemployed people in the UAE are young. Even the most innovative people would be young men and women, who would be the focus of the enterprise initiative. Other aspects would be employment status, languages, location, and gender. Thus, the IMC campaign would be designed and implemented on the platform of the aspects of demographics.\\n\\nThe target audience\\n\\nEvery media campaign should have a target audience. The initiative would focus on establishing opportunities for unemployed persons in the UAE. Also, it would aim at supporting those who would be difficult to employ so that they would earn a living. However, the target audience should be characterized by a high level of entrepreneurial spirit. Apart from focusing on school leavers, the plan would also aim at creating awareness of excellent entrepreneurship among artisans in the region. It is important to note that the IMC campaign would not be limited to gender and location because it will cover the entire region.\\n'),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Food preference is actually a pretty complex topic and involves both biological and cultural factors. First, taste preference is linked to taste perception basically your ability to taste salty, sweet, sour, bitter and nowadays umami. Each flavor provides a signal as to the content of the food being consumed. On a really basic level, taste preferences are linked with those flavors associated with getting the nutrients you need to survive and avoiding those things which can hurt you. Salty flavors tend to be indicative of mineral (particularly sodium) content, while sweet flavors are associated with sugar content. Both of these are essential to life, with sugar providing energy and minerals being necessary for various metabolic processes. Among primates, these flavors tend to increase feeding and are preferred (within limits of course). Sour flavors tend to be associated with acids in food, and may be associated with the ability to pick out ripe from unripe fruit a very useful trait in an evolutionary sense. Bitter flavors on the other hand are typically associated with poisons. As a result, bitter foods are typically avoided. If memory serves, there is some evidence that umami is associated with the presence of amino acids, which are used to build proteins within the body. It is also interesting to note that individual differences in taste perception can lead to differences in preference when it comes to things that a specific individual will like or not like. For example, some individuals are bitter \"supertasters\" who have a high sensitivity to bitter compounds. Often these individuals will avoid foods which are high in secondary compounds (e.g., Raw Kale, Brussel Sprouts, etc) that are put in by the plant to deter consumption. While this may provide some advantages in avoiding poisonous foods (e.g., cyanide containing cassava), it can also limit an individual\\'s diet to some extent. There is also a cultural and learning element to food preference. People in one culture will often develop a liking for foods which seem unpalatable to those in another. What you eat is often what is socially acceptable to eat. For example, in some cultures people will eat dog or rat meat, but this is repulsive to most individuals in the US. Likewise, people also learn what is \"good\" to eat based off what is available within a specific cultural context. For example, spicy Thai food is often unpalatable to westerners who didn\\'t grow up with it and didn\\'t learn that is what food is supposed to taste like during development.'),\n",

Business ethics is a kind of specialized or applied ethics, which assesses ethical standards and moral issues that emerge in a business setting. Business ethics relates to all facets of business and it is also significant to the behavior of people and the organization at large.\\n\\nBusiness ethics focuses on new or controversial trends and aspects that the society and business approve. It illustrates business philosophy, which aims at actualizing the basic goals of business. Specific business ethics varies and applies to interaction with customers and the society at large. Business ethics characteristically involves five types of activities. This paper sets to examine and detail each of these activities.\\n\\nActivities of Business Ethics\\n\\nA typical activity of business ethics includes the effective employment of universal ethical principles to specific activities and instances in business. This is made possible by adequate understanding of universal ethical standards, ability to recognize how universal ethical standards are applied in the business environment, knowledge and understanding of principal controversial matters in business ethics, and examine the advantages and disadvantages of controversial business choice and conclusions from an ethical point of view.\\n\\nThe attempt to analytically examine normative ethics is also an activity of business ethics. Normative ethics develops the provision of descriptive ethics and also makes efforts to provide and defend a comprehensible moral system grounded on it. Descriptive ethics involves the study and description of the society, individuals or culture morality, relates and compares the distinct ethical systems, as well as beliefs and codes, and makes available essential materials that normative ethics is responsible for.\\n\\nMetaethics  the investigation of the meaning and origination of ethical principles is a typical activity of business ethics. This activity of business ethics centers on what moral terms actually mean, it analyzes the sense of moral reasoning, and investigates obscured presuppositions and presents them for intense examination.\\n\\nAnother activity of ethical business is the examination of business presuppositions. Business ethics set to critically identify and analyze presuppositions of business.\\n\\nMinimizing moral difficulties to organizational or managerial problems from time to time is another typical activity that business ethics undertakes. Several ethical issues exist. An example is the behavior of current broker causing financial crisis. Business ethics deals with the occasional reduction of such moral problems to organizational problems.\\n\\nFinally, the activity of identifying and describing commendable moral practices and actions of business organizations and individuals is another involvement of business ethics.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nBusiness ethics is the critical and organized assessment of individuals and organization뗩 behavior in the business environment.

       " Document(page_content='Meiji and Economic Miracle in Japan Essay\\n\\nThe rapid modernization and industrialization that took place in Japan happened almost by chance. In 1853, Japan had reluctantly given in to Western influence during the Tokugawa Reign. However, the overthrow of Tokugawa in 1968 by the Meiji Restoration marked the actual beginning of 딴conomic miracle. The period that followed the coup was marked by sharp disagreements on how the country would deal with Western influence.\\n\\nConsequently, one school of thought was of the view that all Western influence should be eliminated from Japan, while another group deemed acceptance as the only logical response to Western influence. Eventually, a path of modernization was embarked on and history was changed in the process.\\n\\nAs part of the transition from the Tokugawa era, Japan뗩 early policies of isolation meant that the country had little if any access to Western technology. Nevertheless, the Meiji Restoration 랑as able to make the gap smaller by agricultural technology developed during the Tokugawa Period and also, instituting measures that enabled Japan to import technologies and ideas from the Western countries (Rosovsky 29). In the period of about twenty-five years, beginning from the 1880s, the rate of economic development in Japan was unprecedented. In the end, Japan had become a global force both economically and militarily.\\n\\nThe factors that culminated in the Meiji Economic Miracle are not isolated incidents, but they are hurdles that all developing countries must cross before realizing overall success. Currently, the globally acknowledged Millennium Development Goals have laid out priorities for lifting world nations from poverty. Key among these goals is the need to make elementary education available to all children. For example, by the 1920뗩 it was not only the economic horizon of Japan that was different, but most of the other spheres of life had been transformed radically.\\n\\nNotably, among these changes was the democratization of the country and a highly and uniformly educated citizenry. The nationalization of the education and the shift of power from individuals to the parliament were of particular importance to the democratization of Japan.\\n\\nProsperity during and after the Meiji regime has often been attributed to the accumulation of talents and knowledge following sustained efforts from the government. It is important to note that Japan뗩 rapid modernization and economic prosperity have only been witnessed in a few countries around the world including West Germany and Israel. These countries are all beneficiaries of what is known as a knowledge-based economy such as the one that drove Japan뗩 industrialization to unprecedented levels.\\n\\nThe shape of an economic regime most often determines its level of economic prosperity. For example, the only difference between Japan and China in the early 1900s was the education levels of citizens. However, it took China several centuries to align its educational regime with that of its neighbor. The take-off period of the Japanese economy depended on educational policies that ensured that all citizens had the same advantages when it came to education.\\n\\nA modern education system has also been applied by other countries around the world, such as Denmark, to beat the odds that come with overpopulation and lack of natural resources within a country. Although the Meiji Restoration was using education as a means of modernization, it ended up raising the quality of the people뗩 skills, modernizing their thought, and making it possible for them to participate successfully in modern economic activities (Rosovsky 34).\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nRosovsky, Henry.

I ordered my burger meduim. When it came, it was well done and so dry I couldn't eat it. It was served on a large ciabatta bread, and the burger was tiny compared to the bread. It was very disappointing. The fries were okay, though some were covered in chili powder. So the food was disappointing but the atmosphere was nice and the company was great, so it wasn't a total loss. Then it was time for the bill. The waitress kindly split the check, and a gratuity was added automatically due to our party size. Everyone but myself and another person paid with a card. Our bills were about 30 with tip included. We both left two twenty dollar bills. The waitress dropped off everyone's cards very quickly and then said, Have a great night, and disappeared. At first we gave her the benefit of the doubt, Oh maybe she does cards separaetly from cash and she'll come back with our change. She never came back with our change. We tried to find her, but we couldn't see her anywhere. We had another reservation so we couldn't stay and complain, so we just left without making a big fuss. I was completely floored by someone being that presumptuous and giving herself that huge of a tip. She essentially gave herself a 15 tip on a 25 bill twice. I will never go back to this place. The food is fancy but isn't worth the price. And I will never go somewhere that steals from me so blatantly.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Sorry to say, that I am not a big fan. Maybe part of it is having had much more sublime ice cream at places like Bi-Rite Creamery in San Francisco where the sometimes long wait is worth it. Or maybe because at a Baskin Robbins, I've never chewed on ice crystals while circumventing an ice cream scoop. I was out bike riding and happened upon what turned out to be Churn's opening day. The women behind the counter were extremely polite and patient as I sampled three flavors. I finally settled on blueberry. I was pretty surprised when I was handed my cup and the scoop looked more like 34 of a kiddie scoop. For 3?? It barely filled the cup half-way. Well, last weekend, a couple of friends and I had dinner at Windsor next door which we found quite yummy. My friends hadn't tried Churn so I went along with it. I sampled the peanut butter which, even the one spoonful was somehow very heavy. So I went with the tried and true vanilla. To my surprise, the scoop this time was what I would constitute as a regular scoop. Yes I got more, but the inconsistency kind of irked me. Halfway through the ice cream, I could hear and feel little ice crystals between my teeth. That tells me something is not totally right with their ice-cream making process. Also, I tasted more sugar and milk than vanilla bean flavor. Overall, the vanilla was just OK. I will happily go to Windsor any time but if someone suggests Churn, I may have to bow out. I don't wish the shop bad business. I like the interior decor, the festive displays of cookies, candy, etc. I just don't feel the need to promote it to others.\"),\n",

There it was the dreaded hand pump, taunting me. Groggily, I got to it, pumping till my arms were sore... Next was making lands, an activity I enjoyed. Then collecting shoes at the temple. This is how I spend 10-15 days of my summer since I was 5. I couldn\\'t understand as a child why I should tire myself so much doing laborious and small jobs for free. But that has shaped a huge part of my life now. My whole life I\\'ve done \\'sea\\'(altruistic helping). I\\'ve always been taught to help people in some form or other. When I turned 10, every other weekend I went to an NGO with 50 kids to teach English, Math, Public Speaking and to even tell jokes. Whenever I used to meet them, they had a glimmer in their eyes, portraying the genuine excitement they felt, which made me work hard to plan every class better than the last. Our family paid for their school fees and their books. I grew up with these kids, I\\'ve heard some kids teenage problems, others domestic problems. They\\'re family, they\\'ve helped me grow into the person I am now. They motivated me to help others like them, so I taught at another NGO, which was starting out, so didn\\'t have many resources. There I saw that 70% of the kids didn\\'t even go to school, because they couldn\\'t afford the books. I never realized how big the problem was until then. That group was huge, around 200 kids! Ironically, 2 weeks later my finals for 11th grade ended, what I saw next shocked me. As I exited my exam hall, I saw papers flying in the air, on the ground, all torn in pieces. Books that could\\'ve got a child to school, books that could educate, books thrown by the educated. I picked up each and every paper, with the support of my friends. that\\'s when it hit me, exam season had ended, and books will be thrown, I decided to start a book drive, I put posters in school, circulated e-posters on WhatsApp, contacted an NGO to collaborate with to touch a larger audience. In one month, we collected around 1500 books. When I gave those books to those kids, their faces lit up, and they told me that you\\'ve made my life. A small effort, got 17 10th graders to give their boards and many more to school. I continue to teach several students important life skills, trying to provide all the resources which I can, through myself, my friends and my family. The hidden talent in the streets of many cities in India, motivate me to get up and help in whatever way I can. These kids have taught me to be grateful and work hard to achieve my dreams. They have taught me that excuses are for losers. They have unknowingly given me strength during my hardest times.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Challenges in Defining and Classifying Normal and Abnormal Behavior in Religion Essay\\n\\nAs argued by Hansell and Damour (2008), defining normal or abnormal behavior even in clear contexts cannot be made without considering the continuum between abnormality and normality. Therefore, classifying behavior as normal or abnormal is very contextual. Religion is among several other situational factors that can affect an individual뗩 behavior. Different religions have diverse backgrounds and beliefs and can cause problems in the identification and classification of abnormal behavior. This is because what is normal for some religions might be abnormal to other people from a different culture and religion. For such reasons; therefore, a professional or a client seeking to identify normal or abnormal behavior may find religion to have a significant influence on an individual뗩 behaviors. Therefore to make an accurate diagnosis, professionals should first lay down all the religious concepts and convictions they hold.\\n\\nEvery religion has different practices and customs unique to other cultures and religions. These unique features may appear abnormal to other religions and cultures. For example among the evangelical Christians, speaking in tongues, visitation by angels, and consummation of their God뗩 body and blood in the form of the Lord뗩 table is socially deviant from the normal behavior to people outside Christianity but is considered normal among the members of the Christian religion.\\n\\nMembers of the same religion have been known to form sub-cultures whereby they share common beliefs and practices. To people outside this sub-culture, their behavior is considered deviant and abnormal. For instance, in traditional Christianity mental illnesses were attributed to evil spirits. Anyone suffering from the same was exercised by the priests and religious leaders. After the evolution of modern psychology and medicine, such disorders have become medical or psychiatric conditions. Therefore, an individual addressing such disorders from a modern psychology or medicine point of view may find the earlier religious approach to be abnormal behavior and deviant.\\n\\nFactors that affect behavior classification in various situations\\n\\nSeveral situational factors affect abnormal behavior classification. These factors are culture and religion, sex, and sexual orientation. However, as elaborated by Hansell and Demour (2008), the continuum between normal and abnormal needs to be carefully considered before defining behavior as normal or abnormal.\\n\\nThe difference between how males and females are viewed in society influence the classification of abnormal behavior. According to Sue, Sue, and Sue (2010), women are believed to have more stressors than men. Their vast domestic responsibilities expose them to twice the chances of contracting depression as compared to men. Therefore, in classifying abnormal behavior among such women situational factors should be considered.\\n\\nTherefore, it is important to understand any situational factor affecting an individual before classifying their behavior as normal or abnormal. Religion, genetics, culture, gender, and sexual orientation have been found to affect an individual뗩 behavior and need to be clearly analyzed before classifying behaviors.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nHansell, J., & Damour, L.

He was unconscious on the ground in the park when authorities arrived and died in hospital on Tuesday. Baseel Abdul-Amir Saad, 36, has been charged with assault with intent to do great bodily harm. But authorities say the charges could be amended following further investigation. Bieniewicz was an experienced referee who worked at all levels of competition, and a husband and father of two sons, according to media reports and a memorial page set up in his memory. \"I speak for all his friends when I say we are devastated. Crushed. Just a senseless way for a great guy to go out,\" Bieniewicz\\'s friend Jim Acho told the Associated Press news agency. Witnesses at the game in Livonia reported seeing Bieniewicz stop play to eject Mr Saad, who had complained about a call and was issued a second caution. Player Scott Herkes told the Detroit Free Press Bieniewicz was looking down and did not see the punch coming. \"The ref did nothing to provoke this attack,\" Mr Herkes said. \"I have never in my life seen something like this.\" Mr Saad reportedly left the field after the incident, and several players got the license plate number of his vehicle as he left. His lawyer Brian Berry told local media his client was co-operating and had voluntarily turned himself in to police. \"Based on certain witness statements that have not yet been published, it is believed that the facts of this case have been mischaracterised,\" Mr Berry wrote in an email to the Detroit Free Press. \"As tragic as this event is, we must keep open minds and listen and wait for all the facts of this case to unfold.\" It is the second such fatal case in as many years. In April 2013, a teenaged player punched referee Ricardo Portillo during a football game in Utah. The father of three died after a week in a coma.

A lawyer acting for PIP strongly denied the report, telling RTL that the product was not industrial but a food product used in lipstick. The company was shut down in 2010. RTL had the implant examined by a chemistry and toxicology researcher who alleged that the materials used, which also included Silopren and Rhodorsil, had caused the high rupture rate from the silicone gel implants. Although the French health safety agency was already aware the defective implants contained industrial rather than medical grade silicone, no mention has been made of additives from the petrol industry. PIP breast implants: Your stories The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons said earlier that the silicone was believed to have been made for mattresses but a lawyer acting for French implant-wearers said the composition of the implant varied. French authorities have advised 30,000 women in France to have the PIP implants removed as a precaution because of an estimated 5 rupture rate. The French health safety agency says it has registered 1,143 ruptures and 495 inflammatory reactions from the implants. An estimated 300-400,000 women were given the implants, mainly in Latin America and elsewhere in Europe. In the UK, 40,000 women have been advised by the government not to have them removed although ministers have ordered a review of data used to assess the risk of the implant leaking. A surgeon advising the British government, Tim Goodacre, told the BBC on Monday that the failure rate was \"quite out of the ordinary\" and he said they should be removed on \"a staged basis.\" No link has been made between ruptured implants and cancer. PIP\\'s lawyer, Yves Haddad, has insisted the fuel additive allegations are completely unfounded. \"This isn\\'t an industrial product but a food product of the same type that goes, for example, into the making of lipstick,\" he told RTL.

It\\'s popularity index is increasing at such a pace that I have seen, in person, students secretly taking up hash even in classrooms while hiding it inside their geometry boxes, pen-caps.

Neglectfulness and carelessness by both teachers and parents is also involved in it\\'s promotion, As the majority of it\\'s victims are those who didn`t got enough attention or politeness from parents and who were regularly mistreated or insulted by teachers in classrooms, So they choose these things for The attention demand and any kind of appraisal by the other fellows. Banning the Shiva caf칠s was an appreciable step by Govt. as these places had an important role in encouraging drug community but it haven\\'t been completely successful due to side-support of high command some police officers.

I shouldn't be surprised. So little of my world is unsullied by Man's hand. This natural, clear blue sky is so unfamiliar that it's become preternatural. Then again, that's the reason I'm here. The four species of Man, driven by inter-species conflict, are burning through the world's resources burning through the world itself far too quickly. I'm convinced that there is nothing in the modern age that can reverse the damage. Another ice age is inevitable. No human on Earth can save us. Our whole Genus faces doom. We need a human that is no longer on Earth. Someone who isn't part of our modern age. Where better to look than a hundred thousand years ago? There is a species that didn't make it to the modern age. Some eighty to ninety thousand years ago, there was another, failed branch of genus Homo. Recent evidence suggests that something more than mere competition with its NeanderThall contemporaries drove it to extinction. My Neander and Thall contemporaries won't even give the question a moment's thought. Why would they? They know that they won evolution's contest. It takes a Denisovan like me to care about losers. Temporal ports are small. I can barely fit a decent optic nanocable through. There's no way to pull resources from the past. I might be the only one who's ever thought of putting something into the past. After all, what microscopic deposit could anyone possibly make that would give himself an advantage today? It just can't be done. But, I can give away a random advantage. I can help the meek inherit the Earth give some other loser a chance to fight longer. It wasn't just technological competition with the ancestors of Neander and Thall that drove Homo Cromag past the brink. Early contact also led to an exchange of diseases. NeanderThall brought a pox upon Cromag. All I need to do is infect one Cromag child that can carry and spread the weakened blackpox retrovirus. One live inoculation, and perhaps the world changes.

Seriously random experiment: go find something heavy, like a couch, or a box that you can just barely lift (keep safe, lift with your legs not your back, don\\'t hurt yourself I am not responsible if you do), give it a go without over straining just to get a feel for the weight of it.

Then try to lift your object again, it will feel a lot lighter, My brother and I used this trick to lift a piano up a flight of stairs.,Specifically, adrenaline increases heart rate, contractility (force of contraction). And it shunts blood supply away from the gut and peripheral system and increases blood supply to the skeletal muscle and vital organs. It also dilates your pupils and opens up your air passages to allow you to see better and to increase oxygen exchange in the lungs.

       " Document(page_content='Community, what academic, research, ardor extracurricular paths do you see yourself exploring at Penn?\" Any and all criticism are welcome! Thank you!! One of the reasons why I love Penn is because one can learn so much in and out of the classroom. A student at Penn is not confined to the program or school that he or she is involved in but can also choose to follow old passions or explore new interests. If given an opportunity to attend Penn, I look forward to restarting violin lessons, volunteering at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital, and traveling abroad. I have always had a love for the violin. What playing the violin, or music in general, does for me is that it helps keep my scientifically- inclined mind from becoming too pragmatic. It helps balance my mind. I used to take violin lessons but painfully had to stop because of the time that my involvement in sports took. Now, being done with high school sports, I will have more time to pursue my love for the violin by taking music lesson given by the Blunt College House Music Program. Attending Penn would be a great privilege. And while at Penn, I seek to not have just a \"what can I gain from Penn\" but also a \"what can I give to Penn and its community\" mindset. What first attracted my attention to Penn was its association to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, one of the top hospitals in the nation. One day, I hope to become a physician and by volunteering at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital, I will not only gain valuable insight and experience in the medical field by also get to help people in need. The Penn Abroad program will allow me to fuse two of my favorite things: learning and traveling. As mentioned earlier, learning at Penn does not only have to happen in a classroom but can also happen outside it too, like in a different country. Where Penn Abroad will take me, I do not know; however, this is one program that I cannot resist taking part in. What I love about Penn is its lively atmosphere for learning, The activities that I look forward to being a part of will only enrich to what I am learning in the lecture hall. Being able to take my part in the multi-faceted community of Penn is something that I look forward to if accepted to Penn.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Change of Death Attitude From Traditional to Modern Way Reflective Essay\\n\\nDeath is part of life; it is inevitable. The perception held by modern societies differs from traditional one. Attitude toward death differs among cultures. Culture is dynamic; people뗩 views, attitude and belief change with time. People뗩 culture determines their attitude towards social and natural occurrences.\\n\\nTraditionally, death was seen as end of life of the deceased whereas in modern society death is taken as a transition period from life on earth to life after death. Traditionally, the rate of death was higher than it is in modern life, people had become 랏sed to death, and it was seen as part of collective destiny of the species.\\n\\nThrough it was treated dispassionately; it was a ritual rather than a period of sorrow and tears. In modern life, proper medication and improved lifestyle have reduced death rate; however, at one particular time everybody will have to die. When a person dies, he is given prestigious ceremony in the name of 랇ast respect; he should be treated decently. Although people have the sorrow and feeling of loss, they are consoled by the belief that death is not the end of life but a promotion to another glory.\\n\\nWhich way seems better\\n\\nModern attitude, belief and perception of death is better than the traditional method; possible efforts are undertaken in the efforts of safeguarding life, they include proper medication. After death, the body is taken to a mortuary where a postmortem operation is conducted to establish the reason for the death.\\n\\nFinally, the person is given a decent burial. Modern perception of death has more respect to humanity that the traditional system. In old days, a number of countries had death penalties as part of their punishments while in modern days there are high numbers of advocates against the deals (Quadagno, 2011).\\n\\nMy religion\\n\\nI am a Christian of Catholic faith; in my culture, there have been changes in perception about death. Traditionally death was feared; people could mourn for a number of days and talked about it in low tones. Currently, there has been the acceptance of death as part of life. When a member of the society dies, family members and neighbors mourn for the death for a lesser period than in the traditional system, they console the family of the deceased. In the community, life is holy; it should be respected and protected.\\n\\nMourning ceremonies take place at the home of the deceased or at a family member뗩 close to the deceased. In cases where the person was a church member, there are mass services in the home of the deceased with the aim of spreading the gospel to the people.\\n\\nMembers of the society consoling family members of the deceased cater for burial expenses; the culture expects that neighbors give financial aid, labor and foodstuffs. When burying the deceased, it is a ceremony with rituals taking place to cleanse and give a decent burial and console the family members of the deceased.\\n\\nWhen a family member becomes sick, efforts are taken to ensure that proper medication has been given; the move is in the effort of saving life. When death occurs, the body of the deceased is preserved at a mortuary affordable by the family/ community that the deceased comes from. Mourners, friends and relatives of the deceased meet mortuary charges.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nQuadagno, J. S. (2011). Aging and the life course: an introduction to social gerontology .

The Bucket List Movie Report (Assessment)\\n\\nThis paper deals with health services provided by the hospitals and nursing and care centers, to the patients who are suffering from diseases which are not usually curable. The paper raises some points that the hospital CEO뗩 can do to make such incurable diseases less painful, as well as help the patients in living the rest of their numbered days of life in peace and as much happiness as possible. The paper takes into account a movie named The bucket List, which deals with such an incurable disease. It shows how the protagonists try to live as happily as possible and do all that they ad ever wanted to do in their lives.\\n\\nThe movie The Bucket List shows two men, Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman, from different walks of life, who suffer from cancer and are brought for tests and are admitted in the same hospital. They become friends while living there. Both have little time left, as told to them by the hospital authorities. So, they make a list of all the things they had always wanted to do in their lives, and had never got an opportunity to do so. They call that list, a bucket list. To make their last days of life more meaningful and probably less painful than expected, both the men set out to carry out their to-do tasks. At some point of time, their lives intersect at a point and they tend to help each other achieve the other뗩 desire or wish. Their lists include some of the following tasks:\\n\\n  * Witness something truly majestic\\n  * Help a complete stranger for a common good\\n  * Laugh till I cry\\n  * Drive a Shelby Mustang\\n  * Kiss the most beautiful girl in the world\\n  * Get a tattoo\\n  * Skydiving\\n  * See the pyramids\\n  * Get back in touch\\n  * See Rome\\n\\nNow, to get all these desires fulfilled and all the wishes come true, there has to be a source, which must get this done. It may be the patient뗩 family, or the hospital itself, or even the government. Whatever the source may be, the aim is to make the patient뗩 life as smooth and happy as possible. As asked in the paper, what is the role of the CEO뗩 of the hospital? The CEO뗩 of the hospital must take a step to alleviate the pain of the patients who are in such a condition.\\n\\nThey must advice them to pray regularly. Besides that, the patients must be given full opportunity to do what they always wanted to do in their lives, so that, they don뗪 have any regrets. Their families must also be completely supportive in making the patients realize their dreams and fancies. The most important thing is that they should not be continuously reminded of their disease. Besides, as long as they are living in the hospital, the staff must make it sure that such patients are provided with, as much as possible, all the things they desire. For example, they can be provided with video games, movies, their favorite books from a library, magazines, and the like.\\n\\nThe question now arises as to who should pay for all the above expenditures? One answer can be the patient뗩 family. In case where the family is not well off, then the government must step forward to help such patients, since, they were once citizens of its country. It is the government뗩 duty to make their lives beautiful, when they just have a few days or months to live.\\n\\nThe most important thing is to provide them with care and support. They need everybody뗩 love and guidance. They must be given proper treatment. Their lives should be made as smooth as possible. Death bites.

       " Document(page_content=\"Summer project\\n\\nWhen summer break comes along, students tend to forget stuff of what they have learned through the year. Noting this, if student would create their own project they might not do it very well because they wouldn't know how they would start it or if they are doing it right. On the other hand, when teachers give advice and instructions to the students, they do better then trying to figure out stuff by themselves. Even though we probably know what we are doing it is better to know that you are on the right path. Sometimes we students just need a bit of a push to start us up.\\n\\nTeachers may affect a students way of being able to see things differently. For example, we learn more things when they are being taught to us rather then us trying to figure out ourselves. Having someone there for us helps us get farther since we have more support. When teachers design a school project, students know step by step on how to do things when the instructions that are given. We also know more things of how to do it the right way. Students can be great at designing things, but teachers can help us more since they know what we will need throughout our future and what it will hold for us.\\n\\nIn order for teachers to be able to teach, they have to go through school themselves. In this case, teachers know what is important for us and what will help us go farther in our future. When teachers design their own project they can check if students are doing it right by making them present them. When students present their project the teacher can tell if they did something wrong and can help them fix it right away, but when students do their own projects it would be harder for them to understand what part they messed up and how would they be able to fix it. Work gets more easier when you know what you are doing.\\n\\nI would be able to understand on why people would think student select is better than teacher select because students would be able to express the things they know and remember. By dong this, students can show on what they have learned from what the teachers have taught throughout the school year. This is a good thing but it is better to be safe then sorry and be sure that we all are on the right track. Another reason might be that students would be able to get creative with their projects and i agree with that, but what would be the point of them being creative and doing it absolutely wrong. When you do a project that you made yourself you won't stay on topic for some time because the information being placed would be about anything.\\n\\nteachers do a lot for us and help us get into the right path for our careers but they also want us to know the important things we will need in are lives. They want us to be successful and help us understand things that we might need later on in our lives. They will be their with us every step of the way to show us and let us understand on how to do things right and help us understand things so it can be more clear. By doing this, they give us instructions on how to do better so this is why my opinion is 'teacher select project' is better and has more advantage of 'student select project'.\"),\n",

My curious soul had made me a young assistant of my father\\'s research team though my duties were fundamentally trivial, supplies, typo, photocopies, etc. When I expressed my ambition to pursuit a dream in U Penn, father did not tell me much except for an email address. I assumed that was the only drawback of having a professor dad. It belongs to Nelson, a former undergraduate student of my father, who is a faculty at the famous Carthorse Associates. It did not take me long to befriend him. However, apart from few professional questions, he barely told me anything about U Penn except \"Yep, I studied Urban Planning in U Penn. Well...it\\'s a great school, you should definitely apply, or you will regret\". Fortunately, I knew what takes to be an independent researcher. Though undergraduates cannot major in City Planning, I managed to find my niche at the College of Arts and Science, the Urban Studies, a fantastic corner stone for someone like me with a dream to design cities in the future. The general introductory courses, such as urban research methods and urban sociology, will train me from an amateur to a professional. Moreover, the interdisciplinary courses, like music in urban spaces, will add a unique flavor to my curriculum; let alone I will have access to abundant urban-study examples of cities across continents and history. Last but not least, the city and the university are two best case-studies. Though highly-developed, Philadelphia preserves its invaluable historical heritages. U Penn has few modern buildings to adapt to the trend. The aging buildings made of red bricks create a solemn ambience.

       " Document(page_content='The Societies of Mali and Ghana Essay\\n\\nThe following is a brief investigation into the social life of the societies of Mali and Ghana kingdoms, revealing their similarities, differences and the possible causes of these differences and similarities.\\n\\nSimilarities\\n\\nJustice is highly valued by the two societies of Mali and Ghana. In Ghana, the king adorns himself like a woman, with necklaces on his neck and bracelets on his hands, ready to address his audience. He listens to the people뗩 grievances in a domed pavilion where he is accompanied by the city governor and ministers among other people. The audience is announced by a locally made drum called 딳uba (Al-Bakri 79).\\n\\nIn Mali, the sultan addresses the audience in the palace yard, where there is a platform under a tree. The ceremony is preceded by song and dance led by musicians of the land (Battuta 51). The need for the regular meetings is to enhance justice and the rule of law among the subjects. Discipline is administered to offenders in public, and this serves as a warning to individuals with antisocial motives.\\n\\nAnother similarity is the great security provided to the kings. In Mali, the king뗩 arrival is heralded by soldiers and military commanders, and after he arrives, two goats are brought along, which 땁erve as a protection against the evil eye.뗖\n\\nThe army of Ghana has over 200,000 men, to ensure maximum security to the king and all the people in the kingdom (Al-Bakri 80). Religion is another similarity between the two societies. Besides the security provided by the army, they also believe in a Super being for overall security. In Ghana, there are twelve mosques where the Muslims assemble for Friday prayers.\\n\\nThere are salaried Imams who work there. In Mali, the Koran is read before the beginning of most ceremonies (Battuta 51). Security is important because it is a sign of the community뗩 stability and peace. The army protects the community from invasion by neighbors and enemies. The genesis of training the soldiers must have been witnessing of war or capture and seizure of other kingdoms around them.\\n\\nDifferences\\n\\nWhile the Muslim religion is highly upheld and recognized in the kingdom of Mali, some people in the kingdom of Ghana practice paganism and idol worship. There is no single recognized religion in Ghana and everybody worships according to their individual preference. In the kingdom of Mali, Muslim is highly valued, even by the king. This is why the Koran is read in the ceremonies where he is invited.\\n\\nThe sultan of Ghana attaches great value to gold and greatly focuses on making his kingdom richer. This makes him charge one golden dinar for every donkey-load of salt that is brought into the land, and two dinars when it is sent out (Al-Bakri 81). He uses gold to decorate his garment and his pets, too. The best gold is found in his land. Gold is his show of might and economic power. As a result, the kingdom of Ghana has a strong economic background and has been able to establish good relations with other communities through trade.\\n\\nIn Mali, the king uses gold to decorate his musicians instruments and does not attribute any economic value to it (Battuta 52). He does not mention anything related to economic development. As long as his people are peaceful, he believes his kingdom is stable. The reason why the king of Mali is not open to trade with neighbors may be due to his miserly nature.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nAl-Bakri, et al. Corpus of Early Arabic Sources for West African History .

       " Document(page_content='Where Do I Belong? What Makes Identity Essay\\n\\nOne of the most complicated notions in the modern world, identity is the most crucial aspect of a human뗩 existence. Once losing his/her identity, a human being cannot live the full life and practically becomes deprived of an essence of life. Because of its versatility and the number of issues it touches on, identity must be considered from various viewpoints.\\n\\nEmbarking upon this investigation, one should start with the physical aspect of human nature. From a biological point of view, identity is predetermined by the gender of a given person. Indeed, in the clich칠d society where men and women bear different social roles, the gender aspect is what makes the core of identity. Further on, developing into grown-up, mature people with shaped personalities, we bear certain social role predetermined mostly by our gender.\\n\\nIn addition, the large variety of social roles that we have changed throughout our lives was also intertwined with our genders closely. It is quite peculiar that a child obtains his/her sexual identity at certain age, but not from the day of his/her birth. Thus, it is logical to suggest that the quest for identity begins right with acknowledgement of one뗩 own gender. An important step in learning one뗩 identity, the physical aspect makes the foundation of the future searches.\\n\\nNext comes the aspect of one뗩 religious belief  or its absence. Something that is completely sacred for a human being, religion must be another important part of identity  its core and the backbone of one뗩 philosophy, moral principles and the world picture. When needing to turn to someone for help, one usually resorts to his/her religious beliefs, which discloses the most secret aspects of his/her personality.\\n\\nThis means that religion must be another significant part of human identity. Helping people to find the intrinsic value of their lies and look for the enlightenment that comes with serving God and following His behests makes another important part of one뗩 identity. Even atheists still have certain religious position  the position of denial.\\n\\nThe last, but not the least comes such aspect of one뗩 identity as culture. In contrast to the previous aspects, this one appears to be the most mysterious one. Unlike the religious beliefs, it can change considerably, being rather subject to the influence of the other cultures.\\n\\nYet it makes the stem of one뗩 identity and helps one to define his/her identity. Embracing the experience of the ancestors, with all their traditions and customs, and at the same time involving the novelties that convey the flair of the epoch, culture is another essential notion that identity involves.\\n\\nTherefore, identity is a blend of one뗩 cultural background and gender specifics. In his/her search of the identity, one has to consider all the abovementioned spheres of his/her life.\\n\\nThough certain element of scientism in this search might dim the excitement of the process, one still has to admit that identity is the crossroads of all the peculiarities of the given person, from the most essential ones like the nationality and the religious denomination up to the things that might seem complete trifle.\\n\\nStill it is obvious that identity is the blend of the cultural and the natural  the two elements that make a human being. Developing and enriching them every day, one can cognize him-/herself and reveal the places uncharted of one뗩 own soul.\\n'),\n",

       " Document(page_content='African-Americans Social Reform Essay\\n\\nPeople got used to the fact that they live in the democratic world where their rights are valued and protected. Still, there was a time in the American history when people had to protect their rights. This period was rather long and people, especially African-Americans, had to struggle for the opportunity to have the same rights as other people did. The social reform was really important for the whole world, but the road to it was complicated and sometimes even full of blood and pain.\\n\\nThe Significance of Brown v. Board of Education and the Montgomery Bus Boycott\\n\\nThe significance of the Brown v. Board of Education was that this law made the rights of black and white people similar. It was one of the biggest steps for consideration African-Americans as the equal members of the American society protected under the Constitution. The same outcome was provided by the Montgomery Bus Boycott.\\n\\nIn these two cases the decisions were directed at the elimination of the discrimination according to the US Constitution supported with 랎he civil rights movement of the 1970s focused the nation뗩 attention on two controversial means of promoting racial equality  affirmative action and mandatory school busing (Oakes et. al 703).\\n\\nThe Freedom Riders and the Montgomery Bus Boycott\\n\\nFreedom Riders were the activists who wanted to make human rights equal by means of fighting for those of African-Americans. The main difference of Freedom Riders from Montgomery Bus Boycott was that Freedom Riders acted, while Montgomery Bus Boycott was a political and social protest campaign (Oakes et. al 694). It is obvious that the purpose these two organizations had were similar, but the ways of striving for the results were different.\\n\\nPresident Johnson and the Growing Civil Rights Movement\\n\\nPresident Johnson supported the ideas of equal rights. He was sure that his new program Great Society would support the growing Civil Rights Movement as it 라imed to wipe out poverty and enhance the quality of life for all Americans (Oakes et. al 692). This means that Johnson wanted all people had equal rights that was one of the first steps for life quality improvement.\\n\\nVietnam War Protests Related to the Civil Rights Movement\\n\\nThe Vietnam War President Johnson started was, ironically, 라n expression of the liberals faith in the nation뗩 economic and political strength (Oakes et. al 696). But the war lasted longer than Americans expected and the outcome of the war was absolutely different. People in the USA organized different protests directed at the war, especially African-Americans who considered that war was an example of American racism.\\n\\nOther Groups of Americans Affected by the Civil Rights Movement\\n\\nThe Civil Rights Movement affected not only African-Americans who struggled to become the deserving part of the American society with equal right, but also other layers of American population who considered themselves infringe upon their rights, like homosexuals, native and Mexican Americans, women, etc. Considering themselves restricted in their rights, these people tried to prove their equality by means of referencing to the US Constitution.\\n\\nThus, it may be concluded that the social reform and the Civil Rights Movement in the USA in 1960-1980s affected not only African-Americans who successfully won that struggle and scored a success in the equality of rights with white Americans, but also encouraged other layers of American population for fighting for the rights which they were promised by the US Constitution.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nOakes, James, et. al.

       " Document(page_content='Topic:  \\n## In some countries, criminal trials are shown on TV for the publics.\\n\\n  \\n***Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages***  \\n  \\nPeople in many nations can watch court hearings on television. In my opinion, the benefits of this outweigh the drawbacks. Although some people think that this kind of TV program is not suitable for some audience, showing court cases on television helps improve public knowledge about law and creates a deterring effect against criminal acts.  \\n  \\nShowing court hearing to the public will help improve knowledge about the law. Many crimes happened because the criminals did not know that what they were doing was illegal as well as the consequence of their behavior. As a result, showing criminal cases publicly will educate ordinary people on the wrong acts. Furthermore, this will also create a deterring effect because people can learn that if they do something unlawful, they will receive a punishment. For example, in Vietnam, there is a program called \"the Verdict\" which reproduces some typical criminal hearings. It explains and analyzes why the criminal acts were illegal, how it affected the whole society, and the penalty when committing this crime thus, it encourages people to be law-abiding citizens.  \\n  \\nHowever, many people criticize that these TV programs are not suitable for some groups of audiences like young children. Underage audiences are not mature enough to understand the whole case and they can be obsessed with the violent details in the crime. This can lead to mental health problems. However because this disadvantage can be solved by choosing an appropriate show time and create warnings on the minimal age to see the program, it is minor compared to the advantages.  \\n  \\nIn conclusion, it seems that showing court trials to the public brings more advantages than disadvantages. This helps improve the awareness of the public about the law and reduce the rate of crime.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Students Involvement in Establishing School Rules Essay\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nStudent뗩 participation is important in the learning process. Learning involves processes that require participants to be proactive, rather than being dormant. These processes include a lot of activities that familiarize human beings with their environment. Like any other civilized organization, schools and other learning environments require rules and regulations that guide their behavior. This paper seeks to develop a plan that can be used to ensure students involvement in establishing rules and regulations, which guide behavior in learning environment. Good codes of conduct are critical to performance in schools.\\n\\nPlan for establishing rules in schools\\n\\nAs stated in this paper, participation is important in learning. The plan discussed in this paper is based on participation of students in drafting rules. Students often get involved in mischief. This is why there is a need for a different approach in rule making. To avert this kind of behavior, a good plan for establishing rules in schools is necessary. The process of setting rules in this case will be free and democratic.\\n\\nSchools are establishments in a society and as such, students should enjoy participating in processes that have a direct impact on them. Rulemaking in schools will be democratized. Bearing in mind that some schools have big populations, which makes it hard to hear every voice, it will be important to have a formula for representation. Responsibility should be taught at early stages.\\n\\nThis program will also enhance student뗩 leadership skills. All stakeholders will play a role in rule making. It will be an annual activity done at every beginning of the academic year. To kick off the process, the following will be done:\\n\\n  * Creation of Interim Election Board- considering that this is a new plan, Interim Election Board will comprise of teaching staff but majorly students to conduct a free and fair elections of representatives. Most schools appoint representatives based on their academic performance. The Elections Board will be mandated to conduct elections.\\n  * Establishment of Students Representatives Parliament- the elected officials will form a parliament and a member of teaching staff preferably will be the speaker. This is to ensure neutrality. Subcommittees in parliament will be formed and given different roles such as Law making, sports and entertainment. The parliament will also create a permanent Election Board mandated to oversee elections.\\n  * Law making process- this will be the most important stage of the plan. Students will get involved in drafting rules and regulations. The process will start with parliament committee in charge of laws. The committee will be responsible for collecting student뗩 views before tabling them in parliament after which they will debate on it.\\n  * Executive committee- this will be the supreme body in rule making. It will comprise of staff s, students, non-teaching staff and parents representatives. It will be chaired by the school head. They will have the power to finally accept students drafted rules, to be made laws of the school.\\n\\nThis plan can also be applicable in a small classroom where every student will take a role in law making. The process will be part of the school뗩 traditions. Equitability will be ensured by forming a committee that will be responsible for different functions. The program will need evaluation at the end of every academic year, to get changes that can be made. By making the process a school tradition will award the process required consistency. This program is aimed at teaching student뗩 social responsibility and leadership skill at early stages in development. The school administration, which plays an oversight role, will ensure that high quality rules are formulated and implemented.\\n'),\n",

       " Document(page_content='There are a very wide variety of people who claim to be Satanists or belong to Satanist sects... but very few people actually embrace it as a religion. Once you\\'ve filtered out those with obvious mental andor attention seeking problems, you\\'ll find that most satanic organizations don\\'t believe in the devil himself. Instead they use the fact that most religious Americans are terrified of Satanists in order to keep our society secular, separate church from state and keep religion out of schools. An example would be a bible belt school trying to institute prayer and keep Bible verses posted all over the place. The Satanic church would then come in and using the same religious freedom laws as the Christians, then insist that their Satanic rituals and prayers must also be included in the school curriculum. Of course then what invariably happens is that the religious nuts freak out and take out all religious symbolism from a school just in order to keep the Satanists out. Mission accomplished..,I\\'ve spoken to a few of them, and it is violent to not credit a teaching when you understand it, so, in a sense, I am one. They seem to follow what Satan teaches in the bible. Free Will. Self Determination. Universal Truth is within you. A Satanist once said to me \"The guiding principle of the universe is that everyone does what is best for themselves\" Which is absolutely true and even used in physics!

The theistic versions make friends with some extradimensional being named Satan, who is usually treated as a demon. There are a few of them to pick from. This can be good if you develop a good friendship. The atheistic ones simply listen to the teachings of the mythical being Satan. As for heaven and hell, the atheistic ones don\\'t believe in that.

       " Document(page_content='Egyptian History in the Riddles of the Sphinx Film Essay\\n\\nThe Nova documentary film entitled Riddles of the Sphinx discusses the building of the Great Sphinx, the largest statue in Egypt. It is made in the form of a lion with a human head; the sphynx is 70 feet high and almost 250 feet long (Glassman, 2010). In the film, scientists and builders seek to uncover the riddle of the Sphinx, posing questions about how the Sphynx was built and why.\\n\\nThe Sphinx was constructed at Giza Plateau, where around 2500 BC, pharaohs began to build pyramids. To find out where the idea of putting a human head on a lion뗩 body comes from, the scientists set out for the desert of Abydos, which lies to the south of Giza. The city of Abydos was built at the very dawn of Egyptian civilization and is now deserted. There are burials of ancient pharaohs, including the tomb of king Aha, the first pharaoh of the first dynasty. In the tomb, lions bones are uncovered, which may be a clue to the sphynx뗩 form. Ancient kings identified themselves with a lion to show their power. So, a lion뗩 body may symbolize authority, while the human head symbolizes intelligence or control. Together they represent the power under control, the power of the king.\\n\\nAnother question posed in the film is how the Sphynx was created. To understand this, scientists looked at what it is made of. The sphynx is composed of interchanging layers of soft and hard limestone, which had been the floor of the sea billions of years ago. By the time of the pyramids, the sea had turned into a desert. The starting point for the Sphynx was probably a huge rock that stuck out on the plateau뗩 surface. Workers cut a trench around it and took the stones out of the ditch in huge blocks. From these blocks, they built the walls of the Sphynx Temple. Then sculptors carved the giant rock remaining in the center into the shape of a sphynx.\\n\\nTo see how ancient people carved the rock, archaeologists decided to carve a sphynx뗩 nose of limestone. For their nose, the archaeologists used tools available at those times  stone hammers and copper chisel. First, copper had to be melted in the fire to be sharpened into a suitable form. By estimating the time it took to carve the nose, the archaeologists concluded that it took about three years for a hundred workers to carve the whole sphynx.\\n\\nAnother question posed in the film is who initiated the building of the Sphynx. It is positioned between two pyramids, and it would be logical to suppose that whoever built the pyramids built the Sphinx. However, these pyramids were built on the orders of different pharaohs: Khufu and his son Khafre. Archaeologists look at the facial features of sphynx and debate whom it resembles to determine which pharaoh initiated it. However, there is no universal answer to this question.\\n\\nThere is a temple in front of the Sphinx with two niches on the west and east sides. When the sun sets, a line of light connects the Sphynx to the Pyramid of Khufu and stretches further to the horizon. It gives a clue as to why the Sphynx was built. The lion was a symbol of the king, but at the same time, the double lion was a symbol of God, the guardian of the horizon. The horizon was believed to be the entrance to the afterlife. Thus, it becomes clear that the purpose of the Sphynx was to ensure the pharaoh뗩 safe passage to the afterlife. The film casts light on Egyptians beliefs and the importance they attached to death, and what comes after it. It may be thought-provoking and stimulating to anyone interested in the history of Egypt.\\n\\nReference\\n\\nGlassman, G. (2010). Riddles of the Sphinx [Film]. Nova Documentary.\\n'),\n",

They decide to choose them because more attract viewers and readers. On other hand, numerous people who have best achievement and involve in many activity are seldom to show, they prefer to show calebrity's life. Honestly, in my view news about popular people is essential, but show unknown poeple who has good achievement is better.  \\n  \\nIn my opinion, calebrities became trending topics because their popularity, so media will show their life or relationship and it can cause media probably get more much money. Nevertheless, sometimes it can bad affect to audience particularly children. It can be happen, because media often make a bad news about scandals or cases which have calebrity, so when people even children see that will influence and follow that bad activity, it's very dangerous. Therefore, I think media should make other good news regarding unknown people.  \\n  \\nAs we know, numerous people who don't have popularity like actor or singer but they have many achievements. It can inspire many poeple, and edia should report about them. For example, Siti from bekasi she got scholarship to Germany because her achievements. She graduated from best university in Indonesia with best score, and because that she got scholarship to continued her study. She is very smart and dilligent, but if you know, his father's jobs is driver's motorcyle or we usually called ojek. It's very inspire many people. I think many people in this country like Siti and every people must know about them.  \\n  \\nIn conclusion, famous people and ordinary people are equal important. Media will get more profit because calebrity and audience will get advantages about good story from ordinary people. From all of them I think media better to make more news about inspiration people but still show about calebrity news because is important to their business.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"I have always been preparing for my future in biology, especially in medical science. Since childhood, I have been more fascinated by dissecting frogs or chickens than polishing nails with five different colors or doing make up with my friends. During high school, while my friends were watching the last night's Gossip Girl episode, I was watching National Geographic about human body and diseases or probably reading the most recent online article about cyanobacteria in Scientific American with great interest. Learning new facts about human bodies, diseases, and their respective medical treatments intrigues me greatly. I have always wanted to learn everything and anything that is related to human body and extend my knowledge in the field of medical science. Recently, I had a chance to further my study in medical science by doing senior research on Do-Not-Resuscitate orders (DNS). DNS, Do-Not-Resuscitate orders, mean that, when the patient is in cardiac arrest, no CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) or electric shock will be performed to restart the heart. Since I was much more familiar with disease-related subjects than DNR orders, it was a great opportunity to learn new part of medical science. To take a position whether DNS are advantageous to patients or not, I searched statistical data which show the success rate of CPR and some testimonies from real DNR patients and medical doctors. At first, I thought DNR orders were similar to euthanasia, which could be an act of passive suicide for the patients. As I learned more about DNR orders, however, I found out that they are intended to prevent patients suffering pointlessly from the effects that resuscitation can cause. Furthermore, in contrast to what I believed on CPR which could save peoples' lives immediately when they lose conscious, CPR lacks the magical quality that people often associate with. CPR can and does work, but the success rate of CPR varies widely depending on the conditions of patients. Moreover, even though when patients survive by receiving CPR, patients are prone to suffer from bone fractures and punctured lungs which might leave patients in worse condition than before. Gathering all sources from online and libraries, I finally completed my senior research paper on the advantages of DNR orders. While I was doing my senior research, I have learned numerous medical facts and terms. But the most important lesson that I learned as I was doing research was that medical science deals with peoples' lives and deaths in either direct or indirect way. Although one might think that research on CPR or DNR might merely show statistical data or facts, those researches are fundamental steps for other medical researches which help patients to live longer than before and suffer less from diseases. My senior research on DNR orders inspires me to expand my interest in medical field. Although death is unavoidable part of people's life, I would like to research on ways to elongate life expectancy and other medical treatments for terminally ill patients so that they will end their lives more comfortably. Furthermore, it would be a great experience to participate in projects on rare and neglected diseases, which Notre Dame's biological science department is currently researching. I would like to be a part of researcher in Notre Dame who supports innovative global health research projects to improve health in developing countries. If I have an opportunity to learn more about biology and do research in Notre Dame, I believe I am ready to reach my goal as a medical researcher and further my study in medical science.

We would need a few tries untill we fugure it out (like most animals do). however you understand that is not the case. As a skill it needs developing through practice and constant sharpening via excersizing. For example to become a better piano player you need to spend many hours playing untill you master it, and then to dedicate a regular amount of time to keep up with it. As you know kids are way faster learners than adults. Inteligence and social skills are closely related and a kid can learn them way easier than a grown up. Further more if a kid does not learn to be social and to develop their inteligence it will actually learn the skill to not use these abilities. And then it becames an arduous task for it as a grown up to un-learn this and then learn how to be social and how to develope its inteligence. Why can\\'t you be inteligent on your own?

       " Document(page_content='Characters in the Movie V for Vendetta Essay\\n\\nThe 2006 film V for Vendetta presents a dystopian story of a masked vigilante fighting against the totalitarian regime, breaking the laws, but fighting for social justice. The plotlines of this movie and particular episodes from it support the premise made by Roland Barthes concerning the limitations of the concept of justice.\\n\\nRoland Barthes discussion of the traditional wrestling matches can be associated with the social order and depiction of daily realities of the citizens of the dystopian state. Barthes (1984) noted that the primary goal of wrestling is to demonstrate the irrelevance of the purely moral concept of justice. As can be seen from the episodes of the film V for Vendetta, the principles of justice are irrelevant for wrestling. The competitors try to win by all means and do not pay much attention to ethical considerations. Taking into account the fact that the main protagonist fights against the injustice of the totalitarian regime, but uses unlawful methods, it can be stated that the concept of justice has certain limitations when applied to the plot lines of this movie. The audience is expected to pose questions of what should be regarded as justice and what methods are correct. Barthes (1984) noted that rules cannot become a true constraint for wrestlers. The same goes for V who does not hesitate to put plosives into a train even though innocent people can die. The question of whether a fighter should use all available means to achieve certain goals is rather philosophical. However, Bathes theories of the limited meaning of the concept of justice for applying it to fighting can be used for understanding and justifying the actions of the main protagonist of the film.\\n\\nThe ending of the movie under consideration proves that the concepts of good and evil are relative and cannot be applied to the principles of social justice. Barthes (1984) noted that wrestling offers an ideal understanding of the order of things because the euphoria of winners enables them to neglect the ambiguity of the everyday situation. Though the main protagonist dies in the final episode of the film and cannot enjoy the euphoria, the fight against the government and the totalitarian regime continues. Fighting for justice, the characters of the film, and particularly V and his followers fail to consider the ethical concerns of their methods of struggle. Applying the concepts developed by Barthes (1984) to the analysis of their actions, it can be stated that they might be blinded by their desire to win.\\n\\nThe concepts of social injustice and wrestling as the best way of understanding things offered by Roland Barthes can be applied to the plot lines of the movie V for Vendetta . The episodes from this film demonstrate that the purely moral concept of social justice cannot be applied to situations in which human life is at stake.\\n\\nReference\\n\\nBarthes, R.

I had been taking ASL for two years at that point, and I excitedly waved my hand to get your attention, and introduced myself in your language. The look in your eyes, I can\\'t even describe. There was a spark, a look of sheer joy that there was someone else you could talk too! From that minute, I knew I loved you. The rest of that weekend, we talked about ourselves. Where we came from. I lived in Portland, and you lived in San Francisco. A tiny voice told me to leave you to stop me from hurting later on, just like it always told me whenever my heart ached for a girl. But you were different. You were adorable, funny, able to hold a conversation, willing to teach me more, allowing me to teach you, we swapped books and life stories. We fit perfectly together. Over the following four weeks, our time together was short; we only saw each other from Friday evenings to Sunday mornings, and even then only for a few hours at a time. But we made the most of it. During weekend 4, I was dared by a few friends to kiss you. Outwardly, I objected the thought, saying you were \"nothing more than a fling.\" But on the inside, I had been considering that myself for quite a while. That Sunday, as were parting ways, I told you what they had dared me to do. You laughed your adorable laugh, and told me to wait just one more week. The next weekend is the one I hope you never forget. We were going to go on a rec trip to Crater Lake, but I was pulled out of the group to go to the top of a nearby motorbike trail instead. And you left your sister and Shawntee, the only other Deaf people at our camp, to be with me. I loved you We hiked for half an hour, reaching the top a mountain covered in golden grass, beneath a cloud-dotted sky as blue as your eyes.

       " Document(page_content='Characterisation of Large Disturbance Rotor Angle and Voltage Stability in Interconnected Power Networks with Distributed Wind Generation Essay\\n\\nWhat the Paper Adds to the Subject Area as Compared to Past Literature\\n\\nMultiple studies have analyzed wind resources distribution and its significance in characterising the stability of interconnected power networks. The article focuses on an area with limited literature. It examines large disturbance stability issues: rotor angle and voltage stability in power networks. The study is specifically based on geographically distributed wind resources in the context of dispatch situations based on profiles of historical and geographical wind generation. The authors focus adds to the existing literature about the characterisation of these networks interconnected with distributed wind generation.\\n\\nFor example, the study findings indicate that network regions with increased penetration rates for wind and conventional generation consist of detrimental stability concerns based on their old-fashioned features. Other studies illustrate that the dominance of either conventional or wind generation can advance or progress the transit and voltage stability of the network. The study proposes the use of equipped enhanced FRT strategies in farms to intervene DC-link transients as well as ease activation of the crowbar and advance stability. Hence, the study adds to the subject area as compared to other published research journals.\\n\\nCurrent Research Gaps Based on this Study\\n\\nCurrently, there are many areas pertaining to the characterisation of large disturbances rotor angle and voltage stability that are integrated with power networks within wind generators. This study focuses on a specific area to address research gaps regarding wind generation. For example, multiple studies have examined interconnections between networks and how they create local as well as centralized stability concerns founded on their proximity or regional capacity of conventional or traditional generators. However, few have scrutinized the large disturbance stability issues relating to voltage and rotor angel stability and how they influence power networks based on the distribution of resources geographically.\\n\\nThe study notes that stability surveys based on variable-speed wind generation systems (DFIGs) are limited in regards to simplified network structures and issues relating to fault concerns, which underscores a potential area of study for future researchers. Hence, there are many areas in which upcoming researchers can concentrate on including investigating steadiness regarding stability issues based on the regional capacity of conventional generators.\\n\\nThe focus of Future Studies\\n\\nThis area of study is widely researched and documented; however, multiple areas can still be explored in the future. The research study outlines key areas relating to the subject that many studies, including this one, have failed to examine. For example, future surveys should focus on equipping DFIG wind farms with advanced FRT techniques to mitigate DV link transients; as a result, they would improve crowbar activation and advance firmness. Current DFIGs consist of all necessary conventional FRT methods, but their efficiency can be improved by the incorporation of modern technologies.\\n\\nThe penetration levels of these conventional FRT techniques can essentially improve the capacity of certain network regions resulting instability concerns in the event of network failures in the future. This underscores the significance of control strategy as it influences stability; however, steadiness features within these systems can remain unaffected regardless of the region or the control technique of the wind generator. Therefore, future studies can focus on many areas, as mentioned above to improve the functionality of wind generator and their functions.\\n'),\n",

It is possible to compete with both simulated players and friends online. The game world is limited to a few sports stadiums where a player performs in various disciplines, including 30-meter racing, 60-meter racing, hurdling, javelin throwing, shot putting, and pole vaulting.\\n\\nAt this point, it is reasonable to explain the core mechanics of Amazing Olympics: Track and Field. Players have four buttons on the screen to control their athletes. These buttons flash chaotically, and the player뗩 task is to press them as quickly and accurately as possible. If it happens, the athlete is performing well, while if a player places a wrong button or presses the right one with delay, the athlete stumbles, loses speed, and fails to meet the rules. The player should perform in each of the disciplines in sequence. If they, for example, fail to beat all rivals in 60-meter racing, the player may not start hurdling competitions. The final victory occurs when the player manages to receive first-place prizes in all six disciplines. Another attractive option is that the players can alter the appearance and uniform of their athletes.\\n\\nIn conclusion, The Amazing Olympics: Track and Field are suitable for individuals who are interested in sports games. Even though the game interface entirely focuses on athletic competitions, successful results directly depend on players reaction time. The faster they press the correct button, the more chances they have to beat their opponents. Even though the game core mechanics are considered elementary, it will be quite challenging to win in a competition and obtain the Olympic medals.\\n'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='As a fourth grader on my first trip to Colombia with my family, I was unprepared for the lifestyle I would encounter there. The difference could be summed up in my addiction to ketchup, which I then obsessively slathered on everything, even macaroni and cheese. The problem? In Colombia, ketchup was virtually nonexistent, a fact I refused to accept. Upset and na칦ve, I decided to go on a hunger strike. Eventually, my stomach betrayed me. I reluctantly tried some Colombian foods -- coconut rice, tamales -- that were placed in front of me. I had never tasted these foods before, for my mother\\'s cooking at home was largely Americanized. To my surprise, I discovered wonderful tastes, aromas, and textures. Once back home, I begged my mother to make more of those REAL Colombian dishes, dishes I never doctored with ketchup. And I was more receptive to other ethnic foods which I knew I would grow to love. When I was a young teenager, we returned to Colombia, and I brought my football to show my cousins. They were not impressed. Instead, one brought out a worn, black and white soccer ball. I had never really played soccer, but my cousins were extremely enthusiastic. Soon, I was despondent: soccer, or \"futon,\" was not easy. But the challenge of kicking the ball and the intensity of play compelled me to keep playing. When we went inside, one cousin tuned on the TV to a Colombian soccer match. The spirit in that room was incredible. We huddled and cheered; the commentators screamed; the fans roared as they waved Colombian flags. The passion for soccer born in me that day influenced me to join my school team back home. As a result of that trip, I have excelled at a sport, formed remarkable relationships in my American soccer \"career,\" and have learned invaluable lessons about character and goals that stem from teamwork. In my Junior year, we again traveled to Colombia, and my goal was to practice the Spanish skills I had been building for years. Embracing my opportunity, I spoke only Spanish with all whom I met, and from them, I learned many unfamiliar words, especially those unique to Colombia. Through these dialectical variations, I recognized a fellowship and kinship that helped the Colombians through hard times and underscored good times. Their verbal play, mellow tones, and open personalities revealed their concern for each other, their acceptance of strangers in their midst, and their unexpressed but obvious understanding of the power of language. I was deeply moved. My Spanish skills increased dramatically on that trip, but my personal outlook and my sensitivity to my own language grew even more. Back home, I was determined to become a more respectful, kind, and helpful person, incorporating the values of Colombian culture into my American routine: decency is universal. From my trips, I understand what Camera means about travel: Colombia helped me to see an interactive world and to understand that I do not belong to that group of people to whom the playwright Noel Coward referred when he asked, \"Why do the wrong people travel?\" Coward meant those who blindly view the new through old prejudices. Camera and Colombia helped me to see and to grow from what is before my eyes and to define the person I am today. Any feedback on this essay would be highly appreciated. Thanks!

       " Document(page_content='Yulin Dog Meat Festival 2015: China Officials Beseeched By Animal Rights Activists As Solstice Approaches Animal-rights groups across the world are calling on Chinese officials to put a stop to a solstice celebration in which thousands of dogs and cats are supposedly killed for their meat and eaten. The so-called Yulin Dog Meat Festival, in the Guangxi region of China, was reportedly banned by the local government, but advocates say the ban has not stopped the slaughter of the animals, according to numerous press reports. One California group, the Duo Duo Welfare Project, launched a petition calling on the Yulin city governor, Chen Wu, to \"act in the interest of public health.\" The petition has gained more than 250,000 supporters since it was launched last month. Andrea Gung, a representative of Duo Duo, told the U.K.\\'s Independent she witnessed the dog meat festival last year. \"Some dogs were still wagging their tails when they were being killed in the slaughterhouse,\" she said. In a video posted on YouTube, Gung said an estimated 90 percent of the dogs killed at the festival each year are stolen from urban households and farmers by thieves who then turn around and sell them. \"Stealing and selling a dog is easy money,\" she said. As the BBC reported, opinions are divided about how widespread the practice is. The Yulin festival has come under intense scrutiny in recent years with the rise of social media. Gung told the BBC her group is specifically targeting Western activists as a way to bring more global awareness of the issue. Activists in North America, Europe and Australia have been mobilizing on Facebook and Twitter, and through petition sites like URL0. Since May, almost 250,000 tweets with the hashtag StopYulin2015 have been sent. The campaigns have gotten the attention of some celebrities, including the comedian Ricky Gervais an avowed animal-rights advocate who tweeted a petition last week from activists in Canada. The Yulin festival is set to take place on June 21. Local officials have reportedly said that they will investigate and shut down any section of the festival that includes dog meat. URL1'),\n",

After noticing that the ticket her dad had bought was for people with handicap, the speaker was astonished by how people view the deaf. In Bridging the Gap Between the Deaf and Hearing Community, the speaker states that deaf people are contented and ought not to be treated different from others because they are neither armless or crippled. Furthermore, she states that deaf people do not feel disabled because they can easily communicate with each other through the Dutch sign language. The society profiles deaf people and create limits that deny them equality in jobs, communication, and accessibility of education.\\n\\nIndividual creation of employment is the most interesting issue discussed in this Ted talk. The deaf population should be in the frontline of demanding fair treatment by society, most importantly, through displaying their ability and determination to create employment for themselves and people of a similar kind. Roos Watte leads by example and sues the government with aim of getting fair standards for communication at work.\\n\\nEvery society is made up of people with common goals, who communicate through language to ensure achievement of the goals. In the current society, enhancement of sign language has accommodated deaf people and allowed them to share their views on different matters. The sign language, just like other languages, aids the deaf to air out their views and ideas independently. Furthermore, the society has come to acceptance with deafness and has accommodated sign languages in the modern education systems (Dawes et al., 2019). Sign language is an art which one cannot understand without practice. Since culture and art are dynamic, some policies need to be changed so as to fully acknowledge deaf people as part of the society.\\n\\nReference\\n\\nDawes, T., Alves, G., Castro, H., Silva, A., & Fragel-Madeira, L.

       " Document(page_content=\"TOPIC: **Women and men are commonly seen as having different strengths and weaknesses. Is it right to exclude males or females from certain professions because of their gender?**  \\n  \\n## Every job for every one?\\n\\n  \\n  \\nIt's true that men are clearly better than women in some spheres and conversely women seem to be a lot more talented than males in particular areas. However, in my point of view, this cannot be a reason to assign jobs to only one gender group.  \\n  \\nFirst of all, members of one gender can be more qualified for a job than those of the other sex in a broader sense, but in this flexible world we can encounter extraordinary exceptions. For example, politics is usually deemed to be male-dominated area, but the current leader of the German government represents the other gender. If working in management roles were prohibited for females, the women's natural flair for politics would have been left buried deep in her heart.  \\n  \\nSecondly, the proportion of male and female workers in some jobs is not so huge (like 40 to 60 percent). And ,surely, one gender group seems to be more suitable for the profession due to their natural features. But if the members of the other sex didn't work in this field, the demand for this kind of personnel might not be met causing the wages to accrue and the businesses to suffer.  \\n  \\nFurthermore, banning people having a career in a particular field may sometimes terminate their burning desire and interest to work and succeed in that sphere. Considering that hard work and a strong wish can beat talent, blocking their way because the job is more efficiently done by representatives of the other gender wouldn't be a plausible option. As a result, society may lose a great prospect in that person.  \\n  \\nIn conclusion, people have very distinctive sentiments about the never-ending debate on whether or not people should be excluded from a job because of their gender and its more problematic sides are yet to be discovered. But, for me, specifying jobs for a particular gender may not be such a fabulous idea in that it can affect the labour market and some really talented individuals of an 'unsuitable' gender will have no chance fulfilling their potential in a prohibited area.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Also worth noting: Animals intended for slaughter to be eaten aren\\'t \"brutally killed.\" There are, in most modern countries, very strict laws and procedures about the humane treatment of animals during lairage and pre-slaughter. The animal can be incapacitated in several ways. Having a bolt-gun drive a small bolt through the forehead, which renders them unconscious immediately is common for larger livestock like cattle. Electricity can also be used to cause cardiac arrest to render medium sized livestock like hogs unconscious. Finally, the use of CO2 chambers to render smaller animals unconscious as well. Slaughter is done by shackling the ankle of the animal to a hoist, and then securing the animal in a holding gate. A slaughterer takes a very sharp knife and quickly severs the carotid artery and the jugular vein, which quickly begins dumping the blood as the animal is hoisted by the ankle over a drain to catch the drained blood for further processing. Nearly all of the blood that will be drained from the animal in this step is drained in less than 2 minutes. The animal stops receiving blood to their brain and passes away in under a minute. Some religions like Islam have dietary restrictions known as halal which forbid eating meat from an animal whose heart had stopped beating before being slaughtered, which means that the animal is not incapacitated before slaughter. This causes some controversy, but religious slaughterers use particularly sharp knives, even more so than regular slaughterers, in hopes to reduce the pain delivered to the animal.\\',\\' Assuming all of the animals needs are met: Food, exercise, mating, socializing, etc. well, that\\'s the trick. For a long time, the wellbeing of the animal was secondary to the exhibition of the animal (or, at the least, not well understood enough to be effectively provided for). People who oppose zoos on moral grounds believe that the reduced chance of death for the animal does not cancel out the limitation on their ability to live a \"natural\" life, especially since animals by definition can\\'t really consent to living in a zoo.\\', \"Because usually not all their needs are met, through no fault of well intentioned people. The fact is, that while we can come close to replicating it, nothing beats the wild natural places these animals lived in.

I for one value freedom quite highly, and would not trade my freedom for a cage no matter how wonderfully setup it was.,\" \"Because the treatment of the animals can be pretty awful, particularly when they\\'re kept in small enclosures and if they\\'re forced to perform. \\'Inhumane\\' doesn\\'t mean\\'worse than in nature\\', it just means that we should be better than that.

       " Document(page_content='Social Work as an Important Element of Society Essay\\n\\nSocial work is an essential element of society, which ensures that people in need can get aid and assistance from skilled professionals. It is important to understand the main directives of its development and potential, which leads to the formation of certain ideas about it. In this regard, understanding the essence of social work from the standpoint of social philosophy is relevant. The starting point of the analysis is expedient to accept the immanent property of a person, where experience is one of the most valuable components.\\n\\nOne of the key elements of a social worker is his or her ability to work with families and veterans, regardless of their diverse set of backgrounds. In my own experience, I had limited exposure to veterans, but diversity-based counseling was conducted during my work in foster care and aiding people with disabilities. The majority of cases involved individuals with various educational, ethnic, cultural, and socioeconomic differences.\\n\\nAnother essential skill of a social worker is the capability of identifying and assessing the needs of psychosocial functioning. In addition, he or she must be able to formulate and integrate effective treatment procedures for veterans. In my own limited experience with veterans, I only had a chance to provide assistance with finding their needs. They primarily consisted of adapting to the conflict-free life in the United States and developing strong coping skills in regards to any form of psychological issues, such as PTSD. During my foster care provision period, I regularly was in a position where I needed to analyze the psychosocial functioning of the clients.\\n\\nMoreover, a social worker needs to be able to implement treatment modalities, which requires judgment and skill in problem-solving and crisis interventions. I had this type of experience when I was aiding people with disabilities who struggled with a wide range of issues. The treatment plan integration was required, and it revolved around finding solutions based on the individual set of problems. Depending on the type of the issue, it was essential that I utilize a correct set of crisis intervention techniques, which was the most suited to the case.\\n\\nOne should be aware of the fact that a social worker must possess an ability to maintain and establish effective working relationships, and it goes alongside communication with representatives, staff, and clients. Although the given requirement is necessary at any aspect of social work, in my experience, it was most needed when I worked in foster care. The involvement of minors made the communication process highly important in order to ensure the effectiveness of work relationships.\\n\\nThe last critical element of a social worker is knowledge of fundamentals in regards to disabilities, medical and mental health treatment procedures, and diagnosis. When I worked with people with disabilities, I learned the crucial relevance of being knowledgeable about acute and chronic pain. It was the main problem among the given category of clients who struggled to perform even the simplest tasks. I also needed to assess their cases depending on their medication use.\\n\\nIn conclusion, it is important to note that a social worker needs to possess a wide range of capabilities. These might include an ability to work with a diverse set of families and veterans and assessing psychosocial functioning through coping skills. They also involve one뗩 professionalism at implementing treatment modalities and establishing plausible relationships through effective communication. In addition, a social worker needs to be highly informed and knowledgeable in the fundamentals of medical practice and terminology.\\n'),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Retailers, Wholesalers and Manufacturers in Business Essay\\n\\nRetailers, Wholesalers and Manufacturers are three stakeholder groups that can greatly contribute to financial success or failure of a business. All three of them are involved in the supply chains of most middle and large-scale product-oriented businesses. The three groups have certain aspects in common but are drastically different in how they engage with a firm뗩 products and its customers. The differences apply to the amounts of goods a group is dealing with as part of its function, as well as its direct role in the chain.\\n\\nRetailers earn money by acquiring things in bulk at a discount from wholesalers and reselling them for a profit. They seek to shift such things across as quickly as possible in order to reduce inventory holding expenses. They, however, then resell the items on a comparatively small scale and don뗪 facilitate bulk-buying. Out of the three groups, retailers are the most consumer-oriented, and offer direct customer service to those who attend them to buy products from multiple brands.\\n\\nWholesalers acquire items in bulk from producers and resell them to retailers and consumers at a profit. Wholesalers take on a moderate level of risk, acting as a part of the chain of middlemen (Bowersox, 2019). To be lucrative, they must acquire items in large quantities and deliver them to merchants on time. If the products do not sell and merchants do not restock, the wholesaler may be left with large quantities of goods that occupy their storage space and are not delivering profit.\\n\\nFinally, manufacturers are engaged directly in the production of goods that are later sold to wholesalers or customers directly, depending on the industry. Although manufacturers are, just as the other two groups, in need of accounting for the costs of taxation, salaries and other business expenses, their risk is arguably the lowest of the three (Bowersox, 2019). Since the manufacturers control the quantity produced, they might adjust it depending on the current demand, thus reducing waste to a minimum.\\n\\nReference\\n\\nBowersox, D. (2019).

Nevertheless, there are precautions you can take to set yourself up for success. I believe that many college graduates who aren\\'t finding full time positions either aren\\'t putting in enough effort, or aren\\'t putting in the right type of effort. As a senior who is graduating in the spring, these are the steps I\\'ve taken to secure a job for myself: 1. Taken several resume and cover letter workshops. 2. Sent out over 100 resumes in my fields of interest. 3. Attended a couple career fairs and sent dozens of follow-up emails. 4. Updated my LinkedIn profile and connected with professionals in my field of interest. As a result, I\\'ve attained three separate internships for this semester, next semester, and the semester after I graduate, all while nannying to support myself financially. Additionally, I have a few exciting interviews lined up for \"real\" full time positions. Consequently, I have a job offer from the company I\\'m interning at, but want to keep my options open. I\\'ve worked hard throughout college, but don\\'t consider myself to be particularly exceptional. I\\'m only getting positive results because I\\'m pushing hard every single day to get what I want. Therefore, when I hear friends from my university who are just as qualified as me complain about their lack of prospects, I can\\'t help but feel like they brought it upon themselves. For example: 1. One friend complains about having to move back in with her parents after graduation, but hasn\\'t sent out ANY resumes for ANY jobs. She could be saving money for the next eight months for an apartment, but instead has given up before the fight has even begun. (Note: her parents are fully supporting her financially, so she easily could be working and saving money.) 2. Another friend who just graduated is depressed about having to move in with his grandparents and not finding work. He said he sent \"fifteen\" resumes and \"should\\'ve found something by now.\" Um... fifteen resumes? Fifteen isn\\'t nearly enough. He\\'s perfectly qualified, but he just isn\\'t trying. My friends are smart, talented, and from a great university. However, I can\\'t help but feel many college students expect a job to just drop into their laps. I have no sympathy for students who aren\\'t finding jobs. My solution? WORK HARDER, and if that isn\\'t working for you, then WORK SMARTER.

       " Document(page_content='Defending the Ideas of Pacifism Essay (Critical Writing)\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThe concept of pacifism has, in fact, a rather multifaceted nature. Particular scholars are currently convinced that this notion cannot be characterized in a complete and exhaustive manner without a descriptive attribute preceding the term. According to May, Lim, and Ansaldo (2015), there are such types of pacifism as selective, active, relative, and absolute. If one studies the origins of this occurrence in detail, a researcher will discover that the mindset of a relative pacifist differs from that of an absolute one. The former accepts the violence in a situation when it is inevitable, while the latter does not. Therefore, making claims regarding the concept being practical or non-practical is always a matter of one뗩 judgments and conviction.\\n\\nIs Pacifism Practical?\\n\\nWhen attempting to give a strict and direct answer to the question of whether pacifism is a practical or impractical notion, the vast majority of responders would admit it to be non-practical. The reason lies in the very nature of the humankind: a man is an aggressive and violent being (Garcia, 2015). Many researchers conclude that war appears to be the necessary means to stop the uncontrolled development of particular civilizations. May et al. (2015) express the following opinion regarding this matter: 랋acifists are people who have let their principles blind them so they cannot recognize the simple fact that war has always been with us (p. 3). Representatives of this group believe that defending the ideas of absolute pacifism is an utterly utopian ideology. Whenever there is an external threat, the use of force is the only way to guarantee the territorial integrity.\\n\\nDefending the Ideas of Pacifism: Is It the Right Option to Choose?\\n\\nDefending the principles of pacifism is the only right decision to make when the choice is still available. Such known historical figures as Andrew Carnegie and Martin Luther King Jr. rejected any form of organized violence on principle (Garcia, 2015). Although they agreed with the statement that humanity is imperfect, they never let it be a decisive argument in a dispute related to the use of force. Even though many critics consider them na칦ve, there are people who follow the path paved by the known around the globe pacifists: no blood should be spilled without a solid reason.\\n\\nWhat Lessons Can One Learn About the Issue from the Experience of the 1930뗩?\\n\\nAt the beginning of the 1930뗩, millions of people voted against the return to the armed conflict. However, with the arrival of fascism in 1939, the situation changed radically. Opinion allies around the globe believed that the emerging socio-political phenomenon could be countered only through military action (Garcia, 2015). The further events development is known: the world was drawn into a war. Through the lessons learnt from the experience of 1930뗩, one may conclude that aggression can only provoke more aggression, while peace can foster prosperity and general welfare.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nIn accordance with the research findings, although some individuals consider pacifism to be impractical, it is still an obligatory concept to defend and promote in the modern society. By sticking to the principles of the given concept, humanity draws nearer the days when military buildup is no longer a suited option to guarantee the peaceful existence to all nations. The faster the governments around the world accept this claim as a vital directive, the sooner the ideas of pacifism will demonstrate their beneficial side.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nGarcia, J. (2015).

       " Document(page_content='Buddhism in The World뗩 Religions by Huston Smith Essay\\n\\nAlthough in his The World뗩 Religions, Huston Smith identifies speculation as one of the religious constants (Smith 93), Buddhism views humans endeavors to ascertain the truth as meaningless and fruitless pursuit:\\n\\nIt is not on the view that the world is eternal, that it is finite, that body and soul are distinct, or that the Buddha exists after death, that a religious life depends. Whether these views or their opposites are held, there is still rebirth, there is old age, there is death, and grief, lamentation, suffering, sorrow, and despair. I have not spoken to these views because they do not conduce to the absence of passion, or to tranquillity and Nirvana. (Smith 96)\\n\\nIn order to enhance a reader뗩 understanding of Buddha뗩 attitudes towards theorizing and speculating, Smith provides the 랋arable of the arrow smeared thickly with poison (Smith 95). The parable was told by the Buddha to his disciples who deluded him with abstract queries. As the story tells, a man wounded by a poisoned arrow did not allow a surgeon to heal him until he would obtain detailed information about his attacker. Replying to his numerous questions required much time that was necessary for healing and relief from suffering. Therefore, emphasizing the uselessness of such questions, the Buddha states that Before knowing all this, that man would die (Smith 96). However, in Buddhism, in accordance with the First Noble Truth, the concept of suffering or dukkha is much broader in comparison with painful sensations; besides physical manifestations, suffering involves all spheres of life (Smith 99).\\n\\nAccording to Buddhism, questions insistently asked by the wounded man fall into the category of non-judged or not considered queries because of their uselessness for achieving relief from suffering. Questions that are merely speculative in nature, as well as answers to them, only lead to greater confusion. It is possible to deal with such questions for years but never come to the conclusion. People can only answer them grounding on their own imagination instead of complete comprehension. Answers given by an ordinary person who has not become enlightened yet will be simplistic conjectures (Smith 98). Furthermore, it is apparent from Smith뗩 interpretation of Buddhism that humans incessant search for truth is also useless because it can divert a person from practice into fruitless speculation (Smith 95).\\n\\nAccentuating the uniqueness of Buddhism, Smith defines it as empirical, scientific, pragmatic, therapeutic, psychological, egalitarian, and directed to individuals religion (98). Although Smith substantiates every characteristic feature, some of them evoke perplexity. For instance, I have never associated pragmatism with any religion before. However, having explored the parable of the poisoned arrow and the wounded man and the Four Nobel Truths of Buddhism, I realized that the Buddha뗩 refusal to answer his disciples questions was really rooted in pragmatism.\\n\\nIn terms of philosophy, pragmatism identifies practice and experience as the main methodological principle and considers the practical effectiveness of theories to be the main criterion for their truth and reasonability. Coinciding with pragmatism in the orientation towards reasonable practicality and expediency, Buddhism goes beyond science and assesses the utility of a particular method from the point of view of its practical implications. Unless the Buddha뗩 랎eachings were useful tools, they had no value whatsoever (Smith 98).\\n\\nSumming up, Buddhism significantly differs from the doctrines of Christianity and Islam. These religions promulgate unquestioning leadership of the divine essence over the human will. On the contrary, the pragmatism of Buddhism allows abandoning its postulates if they are beneath criticism and do not entail reasonable practicality.\\n\\nWork Cited\\n\\nSmith, Huston.

       " Document(page_content='Aspects of Tort Cases Coursework\\n\\nA tort can be defined as a wrong that arises when a person breaches the civil rights of another. In cases of tort, there must not be a contractual obligation between parties. The breach of civil duty may result in cases that remedy damages. In this case, there are tortuous acts that were committed. The first element of a tort is negligence. The owners of the hotel owe Anna a duty of care as their customer and should ensure that the food served is good for human consumption. In this case, the duty of care has been breached by the presence of a piece of glass in the meal. Ann (plaintiff) as a result has suffered injuries and can therefore sue the hotel owners and receive damages from the defendant, the owners of the hotel. The defense of the hotel management is that injuries claimed are trivial and should therefore be pardoned. They may also claim that the action was unintentional and arises due to human error.\\n\\nThe surgeon has also committed negligence to Anna by mistaking Anna and amputating her. Anna as a result has suffered injuries by losing her leg. She is therefore a potential plaintiff in this case and can sue the doctor (claimant) for negligence. The doctor owes his patients a duty of care which he has breached by administering the wrong treatment. The doctor is the defendant in this case and can claim defense of unintentional commission of the act. Another tortuous act in the case is trespass. The waiter (defendant) who was pouring wine can also be charged with trespassing to the body for spinning and bumping into Anna뗩 waiter (claimant). By bumping into her, she pushes her and thereby falls. This waiter can defend herself by claiming that her spinning was an act of self-defense and was thus unintentional. This could make her be relieved of the burden of paying damages.\\n\\nThe old lady who was injured by the crowd who were vacating the room can also sue for trespass to the body. Here she is the claimant and those in the crowd become the defendants. The serious injuries experienced will become a ground for basing the damages. However, those in the crowd can claim self-defense as a reason for this act. They might also claim that the act was unintentional and hence not admissible. The third tort that can be adduced from the case is a nuisance. Nuisance is the actions that tend to interfere with others in the enjoyment of their rights. In this scenario, the loud noise that is made by Anna can be described as a nuisance to the hotel users. Due to the loud noise, those at the hotel interfered with their enjoyment of their stay at the premises. The users are therefore potential plaintiffs in the case with Anna being the defendant. In this case, Anna can claim defense that her actions were a result of the glass which was in the meal. The damages that she should pay would be reduced by a percentage or absolutely since it was contributory negligence i.e. her action was caused by others. Tort actions lead to civil actions that will result in the payment of damages.\\n'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Online and Face-to-face Counselling Critical Essay\\n\\nThis paper dwells upon the attitude towards online counselling services compared to face-to-face services. Rochlen, Beretvas and Zack (2004) note that the use of the Internet for various healthcare purposes (including counselling) have been a matter of wide-scale discussion. More so, numerous online resources are being created and the market of online counselling services is likely to expand.\\n\\nHowever, there are no empirical data on the way these services are perceived by people. It is also unclear whether these services are effective for the clients. The purpose of the study was to identify attitudes towards online counselling and to develop a proper scale to measure clients attitudes as well as to check its validity.\\n\\nRochlen et al. (2004) hypothesised that clients would have more positive attitudes towards face-to-face counselling services than to online counselling. It was also hypothesised that the scale would be multidimensional.\\n\\nThe participants of the survey were undergraduates from a south-western university. 471 participant took part in the research. The age of the samples ranged from 18 to 41 and 69% of the participants were females. The largest ethnic groups were Caucasian (54.8%), Asian American (21%), Hispanic (7.2%).\\n\\nThe participants were divided into two groups to develop measurement scales. Then the participants from the two groups were used to identify attitudes towards online counselling. The results of the research support the hypothesis concerning people뗩 attitudes towards online counselling.\\n\\nRochlen et al. (2004) note that participants expressed favourable attitudes towards face-to-face counselling and only some participants expressed neutral or slightly positive attitudes towards online counselling. The researchers also identified a gender difference as female participants expressed more positive attitudes towards face-to-face counselling than male participants.\\n\\nThe researchers conclude that the research in this filed should be expanded. They stress that people prefer face-to-face counselling to online counselling. Rochlen et al. (2004) also suggest that this can be due to the lack of acquaintance with such kind of online services.\\n\\nThe researchers also identify the major limitation of the study. They note that the cohort of samples was quite homogeneous as only college students took part in the research. The study has numerous implications for practitioners who can consider developing online counselling services.\\n\\nThe article in question is rather effective and it unveils quite important trends. It is clear that people still prefer face-to-face counselling to online counselling services. It includes tables with the necessary explanations. One of the weaknesses of the article is the part concerning the scale.\\n\\nThis aspect needs specific attention and should be developed in a separate survey in detail. However, the findings of the article are still important to the reader as it provides insights into the future of online counselling.\\n\\nIn conclusion, it is possible to note that the article is quite clear and concise when it comes to identifying attitudes towards online counselling. It contributes significantly to the knowledge base of counselling. The article can be appropriate for a wide audience.\\n\\nIt is obvious that the filed is not researched enough and needs further attention. It is important to reach people with diverse backgrounds and health conditions. It is also important to compare attitudes of people who have been acquainted with online counselling and those who have not. Finally, it is important to compare the way both types of counselling affect clients (which type is more beneficial).\\n\\nReference List\\n\\nRochlen, A.B., Beretvas, S.N., & Zack, J.S. (2008).

       " Document(page_content='Modern Technology Role in Effective Business Communication Essay\\n\\nAs it would be observed, communication is an integral part of human life. This simply refers to the process or act of passing information from one party to another through various interactive ways. As a matter of fact, nothing in this world can successfully be accomplished without effective communication between the parties involved. The power to communicate gives people the ability to exchange information and be able to understand each other. In this regard, communication plays a crucial role in our daily lives.\\n\\nEffective business communication is the basis upon which the reputation and credibility of any business are placed, and for that reason, it is essential for the success of organizations. In order to survive and prosper in modern competitive business environment, organizations should always maintain good relationships with their clients and stakeholders through effective communication. There are numerous communication methods that are applicable in today뗩 business environment.\\n\\nHowever, businesses should settle for the most appropriate methods that would eventually ensure them to successfully achieve their business goals and objectives. This paper examines the use of modern technology as an appropriate method of communication in today뗩 business environment.\\n\\nNothing fulfills an obligation better than doing it in the most appropriate way. The current human generation lives in an era of rampant technological advancements where things change very fast, as a result of innovations in technology. Everything in life, including the way we communicate with each other, has completely changed due to the impact of modern technology. Computers and other modern technologies have significantly changed the way people interact in business settings.\\n\\nFor instance, the social media together with electronic mail have become increasingly popular mediums of business communication. Nowadays, people spend more time exchanging ideas and information over popular social networking sites, such as, Facebook and Twitter, or among other common interactive platforms. These World Wide Web-based portals have proved to be appropriate ways through which people could pass and receive important information in a secure and convenient manner.\\n\\nWith the advance of the mobile phone sector, the use of modern technology for effective business communication has just taken another course. People do not need computers in order to go online, since various interactive Web-based portals are now easily accessible through the applications of a Smartphone, where we can freely interact with colleagues, business associates, and close family members.\\n\\nThe global use of Smartphone is observed to have grown substantially in the last few years. This, however, is a clear indication of the kind of attitude and confidence which the global populations have on the gadgets, which are not only reliable communication devices, but also convenient instruments of Web-based interaction.\\n\\nAs it is evident in this paper, modern technology offers a convenient basis upon which important information between key business units could be exchanged. In that respect, businesses should see modern technology as the most appropriate method of communication in today뗩 business environment, considering the great potential offered by the technological advancements.\\n'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Crimes in the United States Essay (Critical Writing)\\n\\nCrime has been increasing over the years within the American society and the world over. People are forced to live in fear of falling victims to various crimes whereby they can be robbed, injured or killed. There are numerous ways which have been adopted in dealing with crime. This paper explores the various aspects that have been embraced in dealing with crime problems.\\n\\nCrime has been blamed on various aspects, but it is believed that the family background plays a great role is determining the deviant behavior of individuals. In this respect, it can be asserted that individuals who have been raised in dysfunctional families or from environments that do not foster good behavior are likely to develop criminal behavior. Therefore, it can be argued that crime problems in the society can be addressed by focusing on the root cause of the problem.\\n\\nThe crimes being witnessed in the United States cannot comprehensively be solved through the implementation of stricter gun control or by incarcerating criminal offenders. The criminal problem can be resolved through socialization process, in which the young members of the American society can be taught on the righteous ways. Since socialization occurs at home and in school among other institutions, the parents and teachers have a big role to play in curbing the problems associated with crime.\\n\\nThe family is the primary social institution which should play a vital role in shaping the characters of individuals. In most instances, parents do not have enough time for children. The children are exposed to dangerous programs in the media including the television and computer games.\\n\\nOther children are left to play with their peers from where they learn criminal behavior. The children who are left uncared for find solace in criminal gangs which act like their second homes. Therefore, the problem can be well addressed by emphasizing on good family and institutional socialization.\\n\\nCriminals and other deviants who break the established laws have to be dealt with in an appropriate manner so as not to repeat their offense, and serve as a deterrent to other members of the society. In this respect, law breakers have to be taken away from society and punished for their actions.\\n\\nThough these people need to be punished, there is need to give them a second opportunity in the society. Therefore, it is important to rehabilitate them to become productive members of the society. However, before they are released back to society, they should be thoroughly vetted to determine if they have truly reformed.\\n\\nThe prison system as it is in the United States has to be improved, and emphasis should be put on corrective as opposed to retributive measures. In this regard, the prisons should be used in reforming criminals and make them productive to the society. The prisons should focus on imparting useful skills and changing the mindset of the criminals.\\n\\nThis will enable them become readily accepted in the society after serving their terms. Most of the criminals have had a difficult background that led them to become what they are. In such cases, the prison has to help the criminals and integrate them back in the society.\\n\\nThere is no doubt that crime is a growing problem across the world. Since the United States is a world leader in many aspects, it has to set a trend in addressing crime which will be emulated by other countries.\\n'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='In my opinion I think that driverless cars would be a wonderful thing to have. They would make it much easier to commute to and from work or school. They would also make taking long roadtrips much more enjoyable, being that you would not always have to keep starring at the road ahead in the long, boring sort of way that we have to now.\\n\\nDriverless cars would also be great for public transportation, being that they could exempt the need for a driver, that would allow companies to make more profit, which in turn would allow for better up-keep on the buses, trams, etc. Also allowing for newer and better modes of transportation to be purchased, all around it would benefit the public transportation industry.\\n\\nEven if we did not have autonomous, driverless, cars the roads would still be better if we had cars that sensed the road conditions and kept track of the driver to help with accident prevention. It would decrease the number of deaths caused each year by distracted driving, and also maybe even help make the human population as a whole better drivers in the fact that we would realize all of the things that we do wrong while driving and maybe try to correct those things.\\n\\nThen there is the other side to the autonomous, driverless, cars. Yes they would be good because they would decrease the number of accidents that are caused by distractred dirvers, but this may also be a bad thing. Most humans, if you give them something that can make them have to work less, will rely souly on that one product to do all that it can possibly do to help them, but when that product has a malfunction it could be disasterous.\\n\\nLets use this as an example, Johnny and a few of his friends are driving up twisty mountain road in his autonomous car, Johnny, relying on his autonomous car to do its job of driving, is paying no attention to the road ahead. The driving system of the car has a small malfunction in the turning system, the road takes a sharp right turn and the cars is going too fast to recognize that the turn is up ahead, the car comes up to the turn, goes to fast around the turn and starts to slip, the car then overcorrects sending Johnny and all of his friends straight into the side of the mountain.\\n\\nNow see this would have been no problem had Johnny been paying attention to the road ahead, but he thought that his autonomous car had it all under control. The autonomous car would be a great inovation to driving, but when human nature takes over and we rely too much on the product things such as this may happen.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The capacity and coverage requirements for 5G and beyond wireless connectivity will be significantly different from the predecessor networks. To meet these requirements, the anticipated deployment cost in the UK is predicted to be in between 30bn- 50bn, whereas the current annual capital expenditure (CapEX) of the mobile network operators (MNOs) is 2.5bn. This prospect has vastly impacted and has become one of the major delaying factors for building the 5G physical infrastructure, whereas other areas of 5G developments are progressing at their speed. Due to the expensive and complicated nature of the physical network infrastructure and spectrum, the second-tier operators, widely known as mobile virtual network operators (MVNO), are entirely dependent on the MNOs. In this paper, an extensive study is conducted to explore the possibilities of reducing the 5G deployment cost and developing business models. This study suggests that the use of existing public infrastructure (e.g., streetlights, telephone poles, etc.) has a great potential to contribute to a reduction of about 40 to 60 in the anticipated cost. This paper also reviews the recent Ofcom initiatives to release location-based licenses of the 5G-compatible radio spectrum at a nominal cost. Our study suggests that simplification of infrastructure and spectrum will encourage the exponential growth of scenario-specific cellular networks and will potentially disrupt the current business models of telecommunication business stakeholders - specifically MNOs and TowerCos. These scenario-specific networks are expected to be: a) private networks, b) community networks, and c) micro-operators. Furthermore, due to the feasibility of dense device connectivity with 5G, the resolution of traditional and non-traditional data availability will increase significantly. This will encourage extensive data harvesting as a business opportunity and function within small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as within large social networks. Consequently, the rise of new infrastructures and spectrum stakeholders is anticipated. This will fuel the development of a 5G data exchange ecosystem where data transactions are deemed to be high-value business commodities. The privacy and security of such data, as well as definitions of the associated revenue models and ownership, are challenging areas - and these have yet to emerge and mature fully. In this direction, this paper proposes the development of a unified data hub with layered structured privacy and security along with blockchain and encrypted off-chain based ownershiproyalty tracking. Also, a data economy-oriented business model is proposed. The study found that with the potential commodification of data and data transactions along with the low-cost physical infrastructure and spectrum, the 5G network will introduce significant disruption in the Telco business ecosystem.'),\n",

We have all herd of people in political standpoint have been corrupt, but what if our own voting system was corrupt and our votes have never made a diffrence in selecting a president by the people. When we vote for our selected president is it really going to change or make a diffence on who gets elected... right? \"of course it will make a diffrence.\" As long as your states electors dont choice by who they feel is the best fit for presidency. On another note what about the Electoral college votes. Why does one canidate always get all the electoral college votes from one state? Why cant we just revert to how many votes the canidate gets?\\n\\nWhen getting down to the nitty-gritty bits of the Electoral College voting system it is a bit unfair in the ways it works in a whole, but that doesnt mean we have to abolish it and start over. The Electoral College voting system has worked for many years. In stead of just getting rid of the Electoral voting system maybe we should tweek it in a bit that makes everyone happy and makes it completly fair. Each state picks how it gives its Electoral votes, but in most states its a \"winner takes all.\" When a state desides its going to be a \"winner takes all\" state, that means when voting all the Electoral votes will go to the canidate with the most amount of elector votes. Instead of using the winner takes all system each electoral votes should be given fairly. When electors votes for its canidates by the people that single Electoral vote should go to that canidate. When doing this people are in-tern voting for there canidate.\\n\\nNow that they Electoral votes are being distubuted evenly there is a smaller problem we face. Electors are the people who actully vote for our presidential canidate. Very rarely do these electors not choose the canidate based on the amount of votes they have been given, but it does happen. The electors are in a way chosen randomly but most of the time are chosen by the presidential canidate. Often these canidates do the right thing and vote based on votes gifen to him by the public. When these electors vote they are not well regulated. What we should do is have a sort of security system that alows us the make sure our electors do the right thing. instead on relying on someones trust worthyness we should have a system that counts the publics votes. When the elector is done with his final vote we would then see if he voted based on public votes.\\n\\nWe the people are faces with another way of voting. We can vote for whatever canidate we please and when done with we will see how many people voted for each canidate, and whoever has the most wins right? This system would most likely give one the canidates an unfait advantage. When Romney and Obama went head to head in 2012 obama won because the amount of Electoral votes, but if we did it by the number of votes it would have been almost completly tied in votes. since Romeny was born in the south most likely each state in the south would vote for Romney. Since Obama was born in Hawiia there is no state near Hawiia that would have the same oppinion. So when using just plain votes one canidate would most likely have an unfair advantage based on the size and populating of each state going for that presidential canidate.\\n\\nWhen suming it all up the Electoral College voting system is in a way a bit unfair, but when using the method given each Electoral vote would be given fairly instead of a winner takes all system. When going for just plain voting it would most likely turn out unfair or a lot of tied runnings. When given the facts the Electoral College is fine as it is but can be unfair and that is why we should use this method in the next following elections.       \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0       \\xa0    '),\n",

If you are driving 60m/h your car is moving 16 meters per second, so just a few seconds that you dedicate looking at your phone could result in a serious crash.

       " Document(page_content='The futurtistic concept of driverless cars is promising and will solve many problems. Admittedly, self driving cars would create a certain amount of problems. However, the benefits of automation in the transportation industry far outweigh the negative aspects. The increasingly technology based world would see many good things come of automatic cars and the amount of problems would be miniscule compared to the positive qualities.\\n\\nThe benefits of an automatic transportation system include the most prominent and beneficial concept of convinience. Without drivers following a strict schedule and being limited in number, automatic cars would be highly and easily available around the clock. Convinience is a key factor in the popularity of many pieces of technology being invented today, so the benefit of having around the clock service would provide a great boost to the success of the cars. The automatic transportation concept would provide another very important benefit. The common problem of drunk or distracted driving would no longer be a leading cause of death and injuries for many people. By automating transportation and effectively getting rid of dangerous drivers, the streets would be made a much safer place. A third and no less positive trait of the automated transportation system would be that, as the first paragraph says, \"use half the fuel of today\\'s taxis\". Caring for enviroment is becoming a more common concern and reducing the magnitude of emmission by any amount would serve to benefit all people. Cutting the emissions of cars in half would reduce the negative effects of humanity on the planet severely. Not only will the reduction help the enviroment, the reduction in gas would even lessen the cost of using the transportation system, resulting in easier access to transportation.\\n\\nUndeniable roadblocks lie in the way of making an automatic transportation system a reality, but the problems are not as bad as they may seem. Examining the logistics and cost of making a \"smart\" system of transportation result in the conclusion that smart cars, as opposed to smart roads, are the most economic strategy to use. The apparent main problem of this strategy is the limit of the sensor technology of the cars. However, the sensor technology existing today is already enough to create mostly self driving cars that require only minimal effort on the part of the drivers. Technology will only advance with time and soon, the technology to completely and safely automate transportaion will be made available. In the meantime, cars using technology such as BMW\\'s \"Traffic Jam Assistant\" already contribute to making the roads safer and less monotonous. Another large issue with the creation of an automatic transportation system is the law. In the case of an accident, either the machine or human is at fault and deciding may prove difficult. However, with the creation of new laws and technology, any situation will be able to be easily diffused and resolved.\\n\\nAlthough an entirely automatic tranportation system is not likely to become an immediate reality, automation is already being applied to the current transportation sytem to increase safety, comfort, and convinience at little to no expense. Through careful examination of the concept, clearly, the benefits of converting to an automated transportation system are much more prominent than the solvable problems the system creates. A movement toward an automatic system of roads and highways has already begun and the future promises progress and positive effects.'),\n",

Poverty typifies deprivation; thus, lacking necessities like foodstuff, accommodation, clothing and water. Concurrently, wealth is the profusion of valuable income or possession of extra material for leisure.\\n\\nThe connotation of the theme is to lessen the gap amongst the wealthy and deprived. This theme contributes to the meaning of The Lesson because the narrator illustrates the differences that exist amid the prosperous and poor kids in the fictitious story. This theme is relevant in the short story since it helps the reader to comprehend the divergence amidst the pitiable and rich. Therefore, it is a valuable premise since it may culminate in societal development and the decrease of the gap among the pitiable and rich.\\n\\nThe narrator expresses the theme, poverty and wealth, by denoting that children in the story come from pitiable families. The narrator says, We all poor and live in the slums (Bambara para 3). This means that, the children originate from slums since one can find apartments characterized with drunkards and smell of urine in its hallway in such residences. This situation noticeably lacks in wealthy apartments.\\n\\nAnalysis of the contrary dimension, which is the expression of wealth, is evident when Sylvia says ㄹnd Fat Butt already wasting his peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich like the pig he is (Bambara, Par 2). Here, the narrator was trying to show the variances amongst the affluent and pitiable.\\n\\nIndeed, Fat Butt was already satisfied with his food consequently wasting it; however, Sylvia and Sugar were desperately leaning on the mailbox watching other kids eating. Miss Moore expresses this theme by asking Sylvia and Sugar whether they acknowledge the authenticity and originality of money. This assertion postulates that the story housed persons with real money and fake money. Therefore, Miss Moore was defining to Sylvia and Sugar the gap that existed between them and her. This is upon correlation to their money status.\\n\\nAs the kids strolled on the street, Miss Moore told them 랈oney ain뗪 divided up right in this country this shows that the city housed persons with noticeable proportions of money. As the kids, reach the fifth avenue, they spot people dressed in different attractive styles and Miss Moore tells them 랎his is the place, implying the differences that existed between that place and their normal homes (Bambara, Par 4).\\n\\nIndeed, it had unique feature that the kids were unfamiliar with, a place, which belonged to higher-class people due to expensive equipment unlike their poor homes.\\n\\nThe narrator illuminates the poverty and wealth theme during the kid뗩 trip, Junebug asks them. Don뗪 you have a calendar and a pencil case and a blotter and a letter-opener on your desk at home where you do your homework? (Bambara par 13). From the ensuing conversation, one can tell that despite of Mercedes having all the stated things at home, other kids like Sugar, Sylvia and Flyboy lacked a desk, homework and homes.\\n\\nIn the narration, The Lesson, by Toni Cade Bambara, the theme of scarcity and wealth become manifest in different incidences among the kids. It shows how poor people live differently from rich. Therefore, I will advocate for equality when it comes to income distribution, which will enhance development.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nBambara, Toni.

Of course the Democrats have been all too happy to oblige, and the blame is certainly equitable at this point in time. Texas led the way to this Brave New World of hyper-Gerrymandering the wiki article has the most charming evolution of [Travis County in the early 2000s] . There are many other things that have undermined the principles of representative government in the US money in politics, lobbyists, fear, hyper-partisan media, the rise of special interests, an entrenched political caste. But Gerrymandering is the final nail in the coffin. Allowing representatives (parties) to choose who they represent, and diluting alternative opinions by spreading them among districts, is at the root of the gridlock in the country. It totally, utterly cripples our ability to act effectively on any issue of national importance. Other problems have gummed up the gears, but Gerrymandering has blown them straight off. I worry that Pandora's Box is open and there's no way back to non-gridlock, non-crazy politics in the US. I think it's even more destructive than the endemic fear of terrorism, which we all know has fundamentally altered the country's DNA. And all the worse that it's relatively silent, it's all backroom-dealing with the only outcry coming from people educated enough to even know what it is. It guarantees no third parties, it essentially makes elections a mere formality, and has totally destroyed the country. At the risk of sounding like a crank, it's a transition form of dictatorship. I think very few people (politicos) would argue for Gerrymandering. What I'd like to see are people who believe it isn't as dire an issue as I do, and can substantially argue that there are worse developments at the core of this country's political problems, or that there's a way back, or that Gerrymandering is not that big a deal.

       " Document(page_content=\"***Topic:  \\nPublic transportation is a great way to travel, particularly within a metropolis. The metro is the most convenient way to get around a city.  \\nDo you agree or disagree?***  \\n  \\nThe worldwide introduction of metro systems has revolutionized the way of traveling in densely populated cities. Henceforth, urban areas residents have voiced agreements as they recognize it as the most favorable means for public mobility. The convenience of underground rails could be proven via two main aspects, which this essay would discuss.  \\n  \\nPossibly the most worth-mentioning factor contributing to metro system effectiveness is their affordable cost, especially for inhabitants of lower classes. To illustrate, a significant fraction of underground railway passengers are economic migrants, whose income is hardly sufficient for private vehicles, and government subsidies could grant them better chances to travel. Additionally, underground railway systems' requirements for annual maintenance and staff costs are only a fraction compared to that of other public means of transport. For instance, taxis operation demands enormous human resources for coordination and customer service, which accumulates to augment the final fee.  \\n  \\nAnother property of metro systems that further enhance city travelers' experience is their time efficiency compared to conventional methods. One reason is that railway's schedules remain active throughout the day, thereby becoming tailor-made for the fast-paced lifestyles required for urban citizens. Furthermore, subway passengers are blessed with a complete absence of congestion, as the nonexistence of obstruction assists bullet trains to go at full throttle. As a result, time wasted on traffic jams and the frustration thereof can be obliterated, thus increase the workforce's productivity.  \\n  \\nIn conclusion, this essay has advocated the practicality of subway stations in the urban environment based on the mentioned arguments.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Summer is a part of the year were students and families can take it easy and relax. Their are many things to do over the summer, students generally spend their time at the ; beaches, pools, a relatives house, and even at a summer job. With all of these activites sometimes students forget what they have learned in school. This is a big problem because everything you learn at school builds up on itself and gets more advanced as you continue through the year. Some school countys realized this and decided to take action. Their solution was to assign summer projects so that the students can retain the information they just learned in there current school year. Many students don't like the idea of summer assignments because it takes away from their break from school. If it was teacher-designed students wouldn't be motived to complete it, if it was student-designed students wouldn't learn the right material. That leads us to the question, should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed?\\n\\nWhen students are required to do something they aren't particually intrested in, they start to lack motivation or intrest. The same logic can be compared to summer assignments, if the project isn't intresting to students, they probably won't give it a lot of their effort. Which also leaves students to hold it off until the end of the summer. The solution to this problem would be to make the projects student-designed. When you assign yourself with a project you tend to do it with more motivation and more reasoning. This is because when you assign yourself something it is usually done with a reason and you have motivation to complete it.\\n\\nSome might argue that the project should be teacher-designed because the teacher knows what the students learned and whats best for them, doing so, would help the student retain information important to the teacher, thus setting them up for success next school year. This is a very intresting point and it is understandable to have the teacher explain whats best for them. Though it still doesn't keep the student motivated. As explained before, students work better when they work on assignments designed by them. This helps the student stay motivated to retain the information better rather than putting it off and waiting till the end of summer.\\n\\nThe way the project will work is as follows, the student will be given options by the teacher as to what project ideas are avalible, as chosen by the majority of the class. The student will then be given a way to work on the project, this could be a posterboard, presentation slide show, or a physical demonstration. Then they will have all summer to work on it. When they comeback to school they will be required to present their project to the class. That way the students inform others as well as retain information for the new school year. To motivate to students even more they will be given a grade on how well they do on the project. That way they will be set up for success.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the projects would be more benifital to the students if they were student designed. That way students can retain the information during the summer as well as having a good time over the break. Though others might ague that if the project was teacher-designed it would be more benifital to the student, we fixed that by giving the teachers a say in the project by having them pick out project ideas while the rest of the project was in the hands of the student. All in all the projects should be student-designed to give them motivation and advancement.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Childhoods were dramatically changing, with fewer opportunities to spend time outdoors, researchers observed. The loss of exposure to the natural environment would have negative long-term consequences, they warned. Establishing an \"outdoor learning hub\" would help teachers, and help shape policies and strategy, they suggested. The report highlighted previous studies that showed that busier family lives, combined with an increased sense of fear in society, children were having fewer opportunities to explore their surrounding natural environment. This was hampering children\\'s social skills as well as risking stifling their long-term physical, emotional development and wellbeing. Therefore, it was important that schools did not overlook the opportunities that outdoor learning provided to bridge this gap. \"At the moment, if outdoor learning is part of a school\\'s curriculum in England, it is largely because the teachers recognise the value of it,\" said report co-author, Sue Waite, a reader in outdoor learning at Plymouth University, UK. \"With so much focus on academic attainment, there can be pressure on teachers to stay in the classroom which means children are missing out on so many experiences that will benefit them through their lives.\" Ms Waite added that the report showed that although there was a significant body of research that supports outdoor learning in both formal and informal contexts, it was likely to remain on the margins of education until the benefits were recognised by policymakers and reflected in policies. The report calls for it to be adopted by national curricula. The report made a number of recommendations, including the establishment of a \"strategic policyresearch hub\" to \"collate existing research, prioritise future research needs and help improve the alignment between research and policy.\" The report also proposed a \"Framework for 21st Century Student Outcomes\" that could be delivered through regular lessons in natural environments. The outcomes were grouped into five themes: \"We need to be a little bit clearer about what forms of outdoor learning meet what purposes and aims (of curricula),\" Ms Waite told BBC News. \"So rather than just being outdoors magically making things happen, activities such as residential outdoor experiences would be particularly effective for developing social skills and leadership,\" she said. \"Whereas field studies would be particularly effective for greater awareness of the environment. \"What we argue in the report is for people to think about the purpose and place (of the activity), as well as the people involved, in order to construct different forms of outdoor learning that will meet certain (teaching) aims.\" Ms Waite said that the findings acknowledged that schools were under pressure to deliver results, and found increasing constraints on time, finance and other resources. She said that linking outdoor activities to learning outcomes would allow it to become part of a curriculum so there would be \"no need to find extra time\" for outdoor learning. She added: \"Getting it embedded within policy gives that extra reassurance to teachers that this is something justifiable to do.\" Ms Waite\\'s fellow co-author Prof Karen Malone, from Western Sydney University, added: \"This report maps the evidence to encourage researchers and policymakers to meet at the interface of research and policy in order to shape a positive future for our children.\" Follow Mark on Twitter.'),\n",

Reference\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nIKEA was selling rugs produced in India. The company had to confront a social issue of being accused of working with suppliers in the developing world who engaged in exploitative child labor practices and other unethical behavior. To deal with the issue of violation of children뗩 rights in India, the organization appointed Barner as an Ombudsman (Christopher, Vincent, & Anders, 2006). The woman뗩 new position provided her with valuable insights into the root causes of malignant practices.\\n\\nBarner discovered that one of the key reasons for hiring children was the wayward Indian culture that prevented girls from attending educational institutions. Another cause of the problem was a striking rate of poverty in the country. Firms benefiting from the labor of children who wanted to help their ailing parents also contributed to the issue.\\n\\nSourcing Challenge\\n\\nIKEA decided to directly confront the issue and address the root causes of exploitative labor practices. To this end, the company changed its contract terms to dissuade suppliers from relying on child labor (Christopher et al., 2006). The program was successful in reducing the use of child labor in India: the contracts with unconscientious suppliers were terminated. The number of suppliers who did not have a child-labor component in the production of their rugs was high enough for the company to continue its cooperation with the country.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nA major ethical issue for IKEA is to proceed with its policy of terminating relationships with companies that do not follow the international minimum age standard. Other ethical conventions that have to be maintained by the suppliers include preventing overstaffing, following wage regulation laws, engaging in the safe handling of chemicals, and other safety measures. The company뗩 suppliers also should explain to their underage workers that they have broken fair labor laws. IKEA should be mindful of the challenges associated with not adhering to ethical policies. The companies that are not responsible for manufacturing their products have to struggle with the consequences of negative publicity and endure enormous financial losses.\\n\\nReference\\n\\nChristopher A.

       " Document(page_content='Comic Books vs. Marvel Movies Essay\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThe book vs. movie had become the hot matter since the beginning of cinematography, and the screening of the books. Ask any reader what one thinks about the movie, performed after a book, anyone, who first read the book would tell that the movie is disappointing. This happens generally because readers usually make their own vision of the scenery, characters, and so on. Readers always visualize it, embody the locations.\\n\\nComic books vs. marvel movies\\n\\nTouching upon the matters of comic books, and movies after them, it is necessary to mention, that the rivalry here is not so sharp. The feature is that the story is already fully visualized, and the movie director is both restricted by the fiction images, and on the other hand does not have to bend the fantasy and think up something different from the origin. Surely, it is rather difficult to cast all the actors just like the characters of the story, but the main characters should be almost the precise copy of the sketched ones.\\n\\nAs for the preference, it is necessary to mention, that either people like the movies or not completely depends on individual perception. The fact is that, some prefer reading and watching pictures, the others like a home video, or go to a cinema hall, with the surrounding sound. But it is necessary to mention, that the rivalry here will never be equal like the opposition between classic literature, and the movies after it.\\n\\nThe only thing that may disappoint an admirer of comics is the screening of the main character뗩 everyday life. As a rule, it is a rather boring, and undistinguished sphere of life. But the fact is that personal life, studies; relations are not displayed in a book. The only exception is the work, which generally leads to the appearance of extraordinary abilities. The plot usually starts from some failed scientific experiment and serious injury. It should be emphasized, that the main plotline is always composed of adventures, the discovery of extraordinary abilities, the struggle of good and bad, etc. Relations, personal life, occupations in a real character뗩 life are put in the first place of the plot only if these are closely interwoven with the approaching adventures or the elimination of the main villain.\\n\\nBut anyone, who has discovered the charm of a book will confirm, that books are much better. The fact is, the book leaves the space for fantasy, and independent plot development, as sometimes it is necessary to read the interlines\\n\\nThis is one of those snooty statements you often hear from book lovers. And while it뗩 hard for a book lover to say, Hey, I really liked the movie better, it뗩 true: Movies can be better than the books that inspired them.\\n\\nTo solve the struggle, it is necessary to tell, that the list of movies, considered to be the worst ever fully consists of the movies, made after the comic books. This probably happened, because the task to make such a film is both easy and difficult. It is easy, as there is no need to think up something new, and it is difficult, as making movies after even great books is the most difficult task for cinematography.\\n'),\n",

When the economy crashed in the United State\\'s, people relied on their cars, until they realized it was too expensive to pay gas, pay parking, but needed an alternative and as it says in source 4, \"people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit...(paragraph 36)\". People do not want to go back to a car based economy. They\\'re finding other affordable sources. Not only does the usage of cars affect people financially, but also emotionally. In Vauban, Germany, as a result of forbidding street parking, house garages and fee\\'s, 70 percent of the famalies do not own cars and Heidrun Walter, a mother of two, who usually bikes, expesses herself about the situation in source 1, \"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way,\". Clearly, the use of less cars result in a finacial plus and an emotional change as well.\\n\\nIn conclusion, \"car free days\" are much more effective in a way that demonstrates the world other options of transportation, an opportunity to save the enoviroment, and an affordable economy to all.

       " Document(page_content=\"Had dinner with five friends here. Four of us arrived and had a cocktail at the bar. We were seated after a 10 minute wait. Someone came by the table to greet us as soon as we were seated but we weren't sure if he was the waiter or not. He said bread was on the way (but we didn't see it till 20 minutes later) and gave us some menus. We sat for nearly 10 minutes waiting for our waiter and no one showed up. I also want to note that the restaurant wasn't too busy on a Friday night (perhaps this review will explain why). One of my buddies asked another waiter for our server. The same guy who greeted us came back and said he was our waiter. I am not going to say his name as I don't want our country's unemployment rate to go up. The waiter made excuses on why he didn't come back. Whatever... One of my buddies who's a wine connoisseur ordered a 2007 Syrah and the waiter brought out a 2008 instead. We politely sent it back. My buddy followed with another 2007 Cabernet and we again received the 2008 instead. How hard is it to update the wine menu? There's a huge difference in wine when it comes to the year. How can a famous steakhouse have such an oversight on the menus. All of our appetizers came before we could order the wine. Luckily we were still drinking our house wine and cocktails we ordered from the bar. Just about when we finished our appetizers, we got our bread. Really? What's the point? We settled on the 2008 Cabernet and had to ask for a decanter. The waiter didn't know what it was and later came back with one. I ordered the dinner special which was 50 for a soup or salad, follow by a main course and dessert. The soup was a bit salty but acceptable. I got the filet as a main. The meat was ok. Not great. I didn't like the fact that they put sour cream and raspberry sauce on the filet. If it was a good meat, no sauces are necessary. The best part of my meal was the dessert which was a warm bread pudding. My other three buddies' all ordered steaks a la carte. Of the three steaks, only one was good ribeye. For the other steaks which were 40, I don't think it met our expectations. You can certainly head down the road to Ruth's Chris or Delfrisco for a similar steak. I personally would head back to Tarbell's which is also down the road. Overall, the meal was so so at best. Not worth the price. The service here was horrendous.\"),\n",

I can\\'t answer you.\"\" Why not?\" I chose not to answer my cousin, but then I was absorbed into my own thoughts. Indeed, it\\'s just a simple word composed of three letters. Coincidentally it formed three unanswerable question in my head: Why? Why not? Why in between? These questions have shaped the foundation of my life and possibly the foundation of humanity. Why? This was probably the most common question. But do you know it has a sibling, who is perhaps the most gorgeous \"answer\" in existence? \"I don\\'t know.\" Indeed, you are right. It could be the only one who is capable of stopping \"why\" without going into a rampage of questions. For centuries, we had constantly asked about \"why\" things happened, things were already in existence, and anything the human mind can possibly imagine-IDEAS, ideas that had transformed the world, shaped who we are today. \"Why not?\" A loner by itself, can be both a question and an answer. Why did John Wilkes Booth assassinate President Lincoln? Why not? Most people would approach the question by asking why? By asking \"why not,\" it might sound as if President Lincoln deserved to die, but an in-depth thinking might allow historians to stand in John Wilkes Booth\\'s shoes, allowing them to figure out more about the motivation (another form of idea) behind the assassination. \"Why not\" can also be thought of as an ambitious beast. Most people would do what the statistic shows. But often by just asking \"why not,\" you are on your way to create the life of your dreams. When people chose to ask why to do certain things when the success rate is low, I realized I should have asked \"why not?\" Robert F. Kennedy quoted George Bernard Shaw said \"Some men see things as they are and say, why? I dream of things the way they never were and say, why not?\" - the inspiration to Yale Professor Barry Although\\'s book of \"Why Not.\" The \"why not\" approach might be illogical but, nevertheless, it could work wonders. \"Why in between?\" Perhaps it\\'s the most uncommon question or maybe not a question at all, but to me, it\\'s the question that has the most potential of discovering the \"truth\" of humanity, if it\\'s even possible to comprehend humanity fully. It could be the key (or lock) to most questions of our civilization. Throughout history, both extremes of ideas, thoughts, and decisions were taken care of by \"why\" and \"why not,\" but these were the small portion of humanity. The larger portion was clouded to the human eyes since most of us could only see the beauty or the grotesque. They were as obscure as the idea of good and evil. What is good? What is evil? Only a small portion of humanity was categorized by these two terms, so why are we so obsessed by them? Have we looked between? Indeed, we have. For centuries, we have sought compromises, peaces, anything that could come in between the things we don\\'t like. But why were we not used to questioning ourselves of the \"in between\" decision. Perhaps we did subconsciously? There is a saying by Socrates that goes \"true knowledge exists in knowing that you know nothing.\" Then does true knowledge exist? Is it possible to obtain the state of true knowledge? Could it be that everything we understood was merely an illusion of knowledge? Perhaps by asking the \"right\" question we could make the world into a better place. To me, how did I get caught was not a question. We had always been caught in the whirlpool of ideas. But one might ask \"are we slaves to ideas? Or seekers of truth?\" Perhaps we seek because we want to escape. Even though we created the idea, but it was too much for us to control. So we remain slaves to idea or \"truth\" one might say. Please tell me what you think.'),\n",

Works Cited\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThe police have a mandate to ensure order, provide security, and manage crime among other duties (Joyce par. 1). These duties and responsibilities are highly risky, as police officers endanger their lives every time they work. Police officers work with a limited budget, unreliable information systems, and technologically advanced criminals.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nOne of the most important tools in police operations is reliable and easily accessible records. All relevant authorities at federal and state governments need to advocate for reliable public records, as they play a crucial role in the effective management of crime (Joyce par. 3). Information classified under public records includes driving statistics, immigration data, criminal cases, as well as information on occupancy of estates. These records ought to be easily accessible by police officers, thus the need to improve their reliability (Joyce par. 5). Due to technological developments, solving criminal cases using public records is quite easy, as most information is centralized in information storage databases that are easy to use and more efficient (Joyce par. 7). Police investigations involve three crucial elements.\\n\\nThe first element is the initial response after police receive a crime alert. The response entails going to a crime scene, gathering relevant information, and advising on any necessary precautionary measures. With the help of public records, police officers establish the criminal record of a location and the people who live there before embarking on a response mission. This is essential in determining the best response to take, as people living in such a location could be armed and dangerous (Joyce par. 8).\\n\\nThe second element is investigation. Main activities include verification of information and preparation of witnesses if necessary. Public records are quite reliable when police officers need to verify information gathered from a scene of the crime, as well as streamline the whole process (Joyce par. 9). The third element is an analysis of all information. Although this element can take a lot of time to complete, investigators ought to be patient as it is a crucial part of the investigation (Joyce par. 9).\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nReliable public records play a crucial role in the effective management of crime. The strength of an investigation process depends on the magnitude of a crime and the resource capacity of the investigating agency.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nJoyce, Tom.

This time, however, we'd also like to focus on persuasion and how to reach someone who isn't comfortable with changing their view. We've come up with some issues that we think are worth discussing: 1. Are are there any techniques that are good for persuasion, but that are usually ignored because they're considered invalid for formal debate? (EG: appeals to authority.) 2. How do you persuade someone to abandon a popular view? 3. How can you make it easier for someone to consider a controversial view? 4. How can you tell if someone is reluctant to change their view, or has no intention of changing their view? 5. What are the ways people do change their views? (EG: logic, anecdotes, historical examples, counseling, etc.) Which seem to work best? 6. What are some of the approaches you've seen backfire and cause someone to hunker-down deeper in their view? 7. How do you handle someone using a logical fallacy? (EG: name and shame, ignore and move on, etc.) 8. Do logical fallacies always invalidate someone's argument? 9. What was the best debate or spoken argument you ever saw, and did it change your view?

The introduction of self driving cars is a positive because they give the driver more freedom to do other productive things, they still give the driver some control over the car incase bad condition come up, and they use many different sensors to ensure the passengers safety.\\n\\nSelf driving cars give people the freedom to do more productive things instead of driving. This is helpful because people could get more work done in the car. Which in some cases people can commute many hours, giving them valuable time to work. A concern with this could be distracting the driver from being alert incase the car needs assistance. Although as stated in the article \"Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up display. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over\". This means that drivers could use the systems already put in the cars that are regulated by the car itself so that if there is an emergency, the car can shut down the devices.\\n\\nThe cars are smart enough to know when they should let the passeneger take over. This is important because it shows you that the cars still give you control in certain situations, and they only drive in conditions that would otherwise be easy. Stated in the article, it says \"In 2013, BMW announced the development of \"Traffic Jam Assistant\". Th car can handle driving functions at speeds of up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless\". This means that if the car starts to lose control or go into bad conditions, the passenger can take over.\\n\\nThe cars that are modified to be self driven are highly equipped with technology to help the car. Stated in the article \"Google\\'s modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and a inertial motion sensor... The most important bit of technology in this system is the spinning sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the cars surroundings\" These sensors all make the car have the important information to make decisions just like a human would when behind the wheel.\\n\\nI think that self driving cars would be a positive because they give the driver free time to be productive, they still give the driver control in certain situations, and they use many sensors to ensure the safety of the passengers.

Some footballers and entertainers have income from image rights paid into offshore accounts without tax deducted. HMRC said dozens of footballers are under investigation for potential irregularities in their tax affairs. Mr Thompson told MPs that on the issue of image rights: \"I think if it was me, I would want to review this.... It is quite difficult to explain to a football fan that that is the law.\" The HMRC\\'s head of enforcement, Jennie Grainger, said that 43 players, eight agents and 12 football clubs were under investigation. Ms Granger said HMRC has a dedicated team looking at image rights, football, other sports, and the entertainment industry. She told the Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC): \"Just on football itself, in the last two years, that team, and wider across HMRC, has brought in PS158m in yield.\" Ms Granger said HMRC is investigating whether some claims to separate image rights earnings from earnings as players are genuine. \"Has it been properly transferred? Has it been transferred for a fair value? Should there be income coming back to the UK depending on their residency status? All of those issues can be part of this,\" she said. The officials also told the PAC that HMRC had seven criminal investigations under way and had made arrests following publication of the Panama Papers, which provided a huge amount of information about the tax affairs of wealthy individuals. The action follows the formation of an inter-agency task force six months ago, including HMRC, the FCA, the Serious Fraud Office and National Crime Agency. At the weekend, the PAC\\'s chairwoman, Meg Hillier, said the tax affairs of football manager Jose Mourinho should be investigated by British officials, following allegations that he used offshore companies to reduce his tax bill. Mourinho is accused of moving millions of pounds of earnings to the British Virgin Islands to avoid paying tax. According to reports in the Sunday Times, Portuguese-born Mourinho, 53, placed PS10m (EUR12m) into a Swiss account owned by a British Virgin Islands (BVI) firm, which it suggests has no employees. The newspaper also claims that Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo used bank accounts and companies in Ireland, Switzerland and New Zealand to process substantial earnings for their image rights. However, Mr Jorge Mendes - the agent for both Mourinho and ex-Manchester United player Ronaldo - denies both claims. He says both men were fully compliant with UK and Spanish tax rules. The statement added that the allegations stemmed from a cyber-attack earlier this year on some sports agents, details of which were prohibited by a Spanish court from being published. HMRC said it would not comment on named individuals, but took \"all allegations of tax evasion extremely seriously\" and \"always investigates allegations of fraud together with any intelligence provided.\" The head of HMRC will appear before Ms Hillier\\'s committee - which is responsible for overseeing government expenditure - on Friday. Manchester United said the allegations related to events before Mourinho\\'s arrival at the club and so it would not comment.'),\n",

Every country has its own wedding traditions which include definite customs and principles of the right preparation for the wedding. Young women in the UAE also consider wedding as the most important and pleasant event in their lives. The preparation for the wedding in the UAE is a long process, and the wedding ceremony is the great beautiful act which consists of several stages.\\n\\nThe first stage is the bride뗩 preparation for her wedding. It is interesting that it usually begins when the wedding date is set, and it can last during forty days. Thus, he bride뗩 preparations require a lot of time and energy. However, it is the happiest period in a woman뗩 life.\\n\\nIt is forbidden to see the bride during these forty days. Only the family members can see her and help to prepare for her wedding day. Traditionally, it is paid much attention to her look. Different sorts of special oils and perfumes are used to cover her body from head to toe. It is also significant to decorate the bride뗩 skin with various henna patterns. Moreover, her hair should be washed with traditional extracts of amber and jasmine in order to make it beautiful.\\n\\nThe members of the bride뗩 family also concentrate on the quality of the dishes which she eats because it is important to keep her purity and even perfectness. The groom뗩 presents as pieces of jewelry and silk materials also contribute to such intentions. These presents will be used for her trousseau which is traditionally known as Alzehba.\\n\\nThe next stage of the wedding is the celebrations which can be held during one week or more before the wedding night. Nevertheless, modern pairs are inclined to celebrate their weddings less than one week. They listen to the traditional music, sing traditional wedding sings and dance in order to celebrate the happiest moment in their lives.\\n\\nMoreover, these festivities are followed with the henna night or Laylat Al Henna during which the bride뗩 sisters, girlfriends and female guests prepare her for her first wedding night and decorate her hands and feet with henna which leaves dark red stains on her skin.\\n\\nFurthermore, it is impossible to imagine the bride in UAE who does not use the Arabian Kohl or eyeliners. The usage of black eyeliners is also can be considered as a definite tradition which is popular for many years. This substance is usually taken from a black stone known as Al Athmad and is used to accentuate the beauty of women뗩 eyes. The henna night is the last period before the bride뗩 wedding night.\\n\\nIt is also important that men and women who are the guests at the wedding usually celebrate separately according to the Muslim traditions. In spite of the fact all the wedding traditions depend on general Islamic religious principles, the approaches to the ceremony can be different in various Muslim countries. For instance, weddings in Egypt can differ from weddings in Africa or India because of following definite customs.\\n\\nWe can conclude that wedding can be considered as one of the most important events in the women뗩 life in UAE.

As the name suggests, it is dedicated to the Italian writer and philosopher Dante Alighieri. Puncher (2013) explores his life, works, and beliefs, which shaped his outlook on the world. The purpose of the chapter is to introduce the readers to Dante, explain his significance, and familiarize the audience with his poem Divine Comedy.\\n\\nThe author notes that Dante was a product of his time. Being born into a renowned family, it would be inevitable that he would become involved in the politics of Florence. He opposed the rise of despotism in the city, which resulted in his exile. As Puncher writes, Dante spent the next twenty years wandering from city to city, all the while continuing with his political writing as well as his poetic efforts (2013, p. 926). He would not return to his home city, as his exile was lifted long after his death.\\n\\nDante뗩 most famous work is Divine Comedy, which the author calls monumental. It is a description of Dante뗩 journey through Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise. On his path, he encounters historical people and mythical figures, all sorted according to their deeds and his understanding of morality. An especially noteworthy feature of this work is Dante뗩 concept of Purgatory, which 랑ould not become official Christian doctrine until well after the Comedy was completed (Puncher, 2013, p. 926). Divine Comedy produced an enormous legacy, which still influences the minds of readers and scholars.\\n\\nAltogether, the author뗩 it should be evident that the author intended to accentuate the importance of Dante both in literature and in history. His works were reflections of troubled life experiences, which, in their turn, were a hallmark of his time.

Overall, ascertaining the context of Dante뗩 life is essential in understanding what he wanted to articulate in Divine Comedy.\\n\\nReference\\n\\nPuchner, M. (2013).

Although practical skills are required in almost any jobs, their importance cannot be compared to the necessity of theoretical knowledge and formal qualifications.  \\n  \\nThere are a number of reasons why academic knowledge is of vital importance in today's job market. First, many professions require individuals to have a complex understanding of theories and hypothesis, especially in the field of research. For example, in order to become a data scientist, the sexiest job in the 21st century, students have to learn a variety of academic courses, such as mathematics and computer science. Second, plenty of evidence suggested that people who study theoretical subjects have the ability to solve problems faster than normal people, which results in higher income. It is clear that problem-solving is the most in-demand job skill for over past decades.  \\n  \\nOn the other hand, formal qualifications are necessary for companies and those who search for jobs.

For example, Duke is playing Toledo tonight, everyone knows Duke is going to win, so if you want to bet on them you have to bet that they will win by more than 20 points. Not everyone will let you bet straight up, but the places that do you need to bet around 4,000 dollars to win 100, not many people are going to make that bet, and if they do, they\\'ll probably be able to pay them off with money from the people that bet 100 to win 2000 that Toledo would win.,\" \"Bookies (and vegas) change their odds as the bets come in.

       " Document(page_content='The Modern Film Industry and Big Tech Influences Case Study\\n\\nWith the development of modern technologies, many spheres of society have gained significant growth. However, this fact cannot be attributed to the traditional cinema industry. It is noted that fewer and fewer people recently visit cinemas and prefer to watch movies online. Because of this, Hollywood suffers significantly from a lack of box office profits. Considering this problem can help to understand better the modern film industry and the formation of ways to solve the profitability of cinema.\\n\\nThe Internet has posed significant challenges to traditional Hollywood movie distribution. The most crucial problem was the appeal of consumers to online cinemas and services that allow enjoying movies without leaving home. Moreover, there is currently a growing demand for old films, the distribution and screening of which has become much easier and less costly. In addition, Hollywood is experiencing difficulties because it does not have complete control over the distribution of films on the Internet. This issue is dealt with by specialized online platforms, which profit from it.\\n\\nIt can be concluded that it is not profitable for streaming services to pursue a release window strategy since they are at a low level in the Hollywood chain. Moreover, this industry often does not have enough income to pay for new, newly released films. It is undeniable that Hollywood has a most effective policy to protect the content produced than the music industry (McDonald, 2016). This is due to the growing popularity of subscriptions to services where customers access many files. However, in the case of the film industry, such subscription services cannot provide freshly released films, which has a positive effect on the work of Hollywood. Moreover, the cinema sphere has a preferential position since it receives offers and requests to access high-quality content from Internet distributors.\\n\\nTherefore, it can be concluded that the film industry is experiencing both difficulties and advantages with the development of online technologies, so it is increasingly losing ground to online movie screenings due to time and higher financial costs. However, the film industry has a significant advantage at the same time, as it provides high-quality movies that cannot be viewed on streaming services. Using this opportunity, Hollywood can regain popularity among customers and increase profits.\\n\\nReference\\n\\nMcDonald, P. (2016). Hollywood, the MPAA, and the formation of anti-piracy policy.

       " Document(page_content='Chocolate Cake and Ice Cream Cake Comparison Essay\\n\\nIce cream cake and chocolate cake are very similar, but chocolate cake is better because it is more versatile and rich in flavor. The taste of the chocolate cake is great for anyone who likes chocolate, and the majority of people do. A chocolate cake normally has cocoa in its base, cream, and frosting, which gives it a very rich, intense flavor. This cake usually consists of a sponge base with thick cream in-between layers and frosting on the top.\\n\\nThis gives it a nice mix of textures from soft, melting ones to chewy and moist ones. Finally, the design of chocolate cakes can vary depending on the occasion and on the person뗩 individual tastes. Chocolate cakes can have fruit, sweets, nuts, or cookies in them, and all of these foods will fit in nicely with the other flavors. Decorating a chocolate cake is easy, because it maintains structure well, allowing to build both a tall, multi-layer cake with elaborate decorations and a small family dessert with a hand-made message.\\n\\nIce cream cake differs from the chocolate cake in most of these aspects. The flavor of ice cream is not as rich as that of chocolate. For this reason, the overall taste of ice cream cake is subtle, not rich. The structure of an ice cream cake is similar to chocolate cake and typically involves a sponge cake base with ice cream used in-between layers. The frosting of an ice cream cake can only include whipped cream or ice cream.\\n\\nThis limits the range of textures that can be added. Ice cream is cold and starts melting fast, which destroys the structure of the cake almost immediately. The design of ice cream cakes is usually less appealing because ice cream melts, preventing decorations from staying in place. Hence, chocolate cake is better than ice cream cake because it has more flavor, a variety of textures, and can be decorated in many ways.\\n'),\n",

In an open letter to supporters, Morgan said Fosun had \"made a commitment to invest between PS20-PS30m over the next two years\" into the club. Chief executive Jez Moxey will also step down after 16 years at Molineux. Wolves, who had been put up for sale by Morgan in September 2015, are the second Championship club to have Chinese owners after Midlands rivals Aston Villa were sold to Dr Tony Xia earlier this year. The new-look board at Molineux will consist of four members, including Jeff Shi, who led the negotiations on behalf of Fosun and will become the club\\'s representative, while local businessmen and Wolves supporters John Bowater and John Gough will also continue to serve as non-executive board members. Moxey will remain as chief executive for the next three months as the club, which finished 14th in the Championship in 2015-16, search for a permanent replacement. \"We are delighted to have completed the deal to become the new owners of such a famous and historic club as Wolves,\" Shi told the club\\'s official website. \"We owe a great debt of gratitude to Steve Morgan for taking such good care of the club and for placing his trust in us to become the new custodians of Wolves. \"During our conversations Steve\\'s great passion and vision for the club and Wolverhampton was very clear and we feel privileged to pick up the baton from him. \"And also to Jez Moxey for his tremendous contribution to Wolves. We are sad to see him leave.\" Shi continued: \"We would also like to thank the hugely loyal and passionate Wolves supporters, and all of the club staff, for their patience whilst our discussions were ongoing. We hope they will be pleased with, and supportive of, our exciting plans for Wolves. \"Our goal is crystal clear: we will do our very best to help take Wolves back to the Premier League as soon as possible and to stay there. \"We believe the club and the fans belong at the top of English football and getting there is our first and top priority.\" Under the chairmanship of billionaire businessman Guo Guangchang, Fosun are one of the largest investment groups in China. They have stakes in various leisure and entertainment projects around the world, including Club Med and Cirque du Soleil, and currently have interests in several UK companies including Thomas Cook. Fosun also has links with super-agent Jorge Mendes, who represents Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho and Real Madrid striker Cristiano Ronaldo among others. Mendes sold a minority share of his agency Gestifute to a subsidiary of Fosun late in 2015 and is expected to play a part in recruitment at Wolves. I don\\'t think there\\'s any significance in the West Midlands suddenly appearing to be the hotbed of Chinese interest as far as English football\\'s concerned. Two factors have combined - the Chinese government encouraging its big economic players to get involved in European football and the stagnant state of the top West Midlands clubs. Since Aston Villa\\'s League Cup win in 1996 only Birmingham City have won one of English football\\'s major trophies, beating Arsenal to win the same competition in 2011. Too many false dawns, too many disillusioned owners. A regional powerhouse stagnating. Enter the Chinese on the wave of a massive interest in football, with their own Super League prospering, serious players being lured by fabulous contracts and TV coverage of English football soaring in scope. The president has said he wants the World Cup staged in China within 20 years. The onward march into English football - and stakes in Atletico Madrid and AC Milan - is just one manifestation of that long-term aim. The money is available to snap up these West Midlands clubs. Other bidders are just being blown out of the water by Chinese money.'),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"*In order to improve a country's education system, young students should be allowed to openly criticize their teachers during class time. What is your opinion? What are some other ways education systems could be improved?*  \\n  \\n## how to improve teaching methods\\n\\n  \\n  \\nThis is my essay:  \\nThere is no doubt that education system has an important role in the development of a country, hence, it should be kept improving. Receiving feedback from students is one of the best way to enhance the education system. However, I am against the idea that young students should be allowed to openly criticize their teachers during the class time. This could lead to unwanted consequences and we should consider other way to transform the classroom environment for the better result.  \\n  \\nFirst of all, allowing children to criticize their teacher in the class might affect the quality of the lesson. For example, criticism from the students might take considerable time for studying and learning objectives of that lesson might not be reached in such limited time. Other students who might not be interested in the subject would lose their attention for the lesson. Hence, this notion though innovative but not very much applicable in a normal classroom.  \\n  \\nBesides, in order to improve the quality of education system, we could extend the time of a normal lesson. This time should be used only to receive students opinions and queries, either in the means of feedback form or conversation. This way, the teacher would be able to understand the students confusion and response immediately or privately if necessary. This solution would give students a chance to raise their voice without wasting the time of the class.  \\n  \\nIn conclusion, letting the teachers be freely critisized is not an effective way to improve teaching. Instead, we should have a separate time right after the lesson for students to raise their opinions. I believe this is a way to ensure the amount of knowledge taken in in a lesson and still, improve the education system.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Evidence-Based Multicultural Practice in Medicine Essay\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nEvidence-based practice (EBP) is one of the key and essential concepts in the health and well-being areas, such as medicine, nursing, and counseling. The core ideas are centered around building and developing procedural interventions and assessments based on the acquired data and empirical evidence. Cultural competence (CC) is also a highly relevant aspect of the practice, which focuses on multicultural elements of the counseling process. Both EBP and CC share the common goal of utilizing key skills in ensuring optimal development of a client, but the former uses the latest research evidence, and the latter is based on cultural differences.\\n\\nMain body\\n\\nOne should be aware that cultural competence is one of the essential aspects of multicultural counseling. A professional needs to understand unique cultural differences among his or her clients. The given knowledge is critical in utilizing the necessary skills for adjusting the practice according to the underlying cues, which might hinder the optimization. Similarly, EBP tries to change by integrating the most relevant evidence as to the basis for client transformation.\\n\\nMoreover, both systemic approaches can effectively utilize scientific literature to improve counseling practice. Although it is a necessary aspect of EBP, CC is also interested in implementing the recent knowledge on multicultural dynamics. Improving intercultural communication is one of those areas in which a simple accumulation of psychological knowledge and the awareness of cultural characteristics is not enough. The future belongs to the development of ethnocultural competence using special teaching methods which make it possible to integrate knowledge and practical experience. It is important to remember that psychologists, and the representatives of other helping professions, are not able to completely free themselves from the problem of ethnic stereotypes, including auto-stereotypes, of their group. They are also subject to the influence on social events, interpersonal conflicts, communication experience, which needs awareness and change of prejudices, shifts in ways of interaction with the representatives of other cultures. Therefore, CC is an ever-evolving process that requires a deliberate effort for increasing self-awareness. This is critical to improving the understanding of how biases, values, and cultural practices affect interactions with culturally diverse populations.\\n\\nHowever, the key difference lies in the fact that EBP utilizes research data, whereas CC uses cultural value distinctions. Culture in itself is a highly complex notion, which cannot be categorized and divided into easily manageable elements. Therefore, a culturally competent counselor needs to be aware and knowledgeable of various intricacies of each individual cultural background. The most important role in the selection of the most effective medicines belongs to evidence-based medicine. Evidence-based analysis of the counseling and medical literature is an important aspect of the counselor뗩 work. The consequence of this approach to the study of the literature is the correct professional activity of the counselor. Thus, the major distinctions can be observed in the key elements, where culture is less definitive and more complex than solid empirical evidence.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nIn conclusion, both CC and EBP seek to achieve optimal development of a client by utilizing effective interventions. Another similarity lies in the fact that both optimization measures can be based on the latest scientific literature. However, the difference is manifested in the notion that the use of empirical evidence is mandatory for EBP, whereas it is not a central component for CC. The primary reason is the implausibility of solidified categorization of cultural aspects due to its changeability and complexity.\\n'),\n",

It is not that easy to clear up whether Ford should be blamed in this case, because the causes of the accident under consideration remain unclear. This is why Ford was not blamed in the Pinto case; however, lots of victims, their relatives, and advocacy groups were eager to blame them and even ensured certain corporate responsibility.\\n\\nSo, it is quite possible to use this Pinto case as one of the brightest examples of how corporations could be prosecuted for homicide. (Clinard, 215) If I were a relative of young daughters in this case, without any doubts, I wanted to blame the corporation; however, the results could easily disappoint me because the modern industry compares human lives with money and truly believed that financial support could help to control the grief.\\n\\nIs the American industry at too many risks for lawsuits to remain competitive?\\n\\nNowadays, competitiveness among corporations turns out to be one of the most serious problems for the population. First of all, the American industry is at risk because lots of organizations want to enlarge their productivity and forget about simple safety precautions. Secondly, many prosecutors are eager to find out some weaknesses of the companies, which may threaten people뗩 health and even lives. Human beings are seen as 땃nits뙉 (Wolfe, 1990) So, if after the case of Ford Pinto, such ideas appeared and such comparison is not strange to many people, it turns out to be one of the major proofs that American industry and the competitiveness are the things, which should disturb people.\\n\\nShould lawsuits such as the one against Ford be disallowed or limited?\\n\\nTo my mind, the case of Ford Pinto should not be limited. With the help of such cases, lots of other huge corporations, which are responsible for the lives of many people, will learn something and prevent the same mistakes. Human empathy is a thing that should never be forgotten. This is why lawsuits like the one against Ford have to be allowed in order to make Ford managers apologize, learn this lesson, and not to make the same mistakes in future.\\n\\nAlso, non-limitation of the similar lawsuits promote other corporations be more sympathetic to victims and provide them with the necessary help and some kind of support. It does not mean that the managers of the companies should cry and demonstrate their feelings on public, however, if these people do demonstrate that they do not care about the other lives, such cases will be worth.\\n\\nShould we try to restrain, in this or other product liability situations, the litigiousness that seems to characterize American life?\\n\\nAmerican life sees so many changes during the last years. Industry develops day by day, taking away lots of human lives. Is it our future  to lose young people, grieve, and clear up who should be blamed or who should be justified? Nowadays, money has unbelievable power and can easily control lots of situation. The point is that those people, who have less money than the others, do not have enough rights to demonstrate their discontent. Should we make an attempt to restrain the litigiousness that is inherent to the case under consideration and American life in general? Of course, we should, and we can do by underlining this simple fact money cannot serve as equivalents to human lives.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nClinard, Marshall, B.

They should be student-designed because more students will be into actually doing it then putting it off and never getting to it, students can have fun while doing a project, and they don't have to be forced into doing a boring project a teacher chooses.\\n\\nFirst, more students will be into it. If a student does a project on their favorite movie, superhero, celebrity, etc. they will have more fun doing that. Let's say a teacher told their students to do a project on Abraham Lincoln, the students probably wouldn't be very happy about that. However, if a teacher\\xa0told their students to do a project on their favorite TV show, then I'm sure that students would actually be excited about it.\\n\\nSecondly, students can have fun while learning. If they did a project on their favorite movie, they could watch that movie and tell the class and teacher about all the funny, happy, and sad moments. You could also learn a lot\\xa0of history by doing a project on your favorite movie, because you'll have to learn about the history on why they made the movie.\\n\\nThird, they don't have to be forced into dong a boring project a teacher chooses. Nobody ever wants to write a paper on history and wars. If the students got to choose about what their project could be on it would be a lot\\xa0better and easier to get a student to actually do it. If you tell a student to do a project on World War 1, chances are they won't do it, or they will put it off until the last minute. A student could actually be excited to do a project if they got to choose what it was about.\\n\\nIn conclusion,\\xa0Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break.

If they keep making driverless cars all the regular cars are no longer going to be in use. That's going to be a lot of money people have wasted on a car that no one is using anymore.

The homily is based on the story of Jonah and the whale, which takes a major part of the sermon, where the priest foreshadows the struggle of Ahab and Moby Dick. It seems to me that the story is called for teaching people not to escape God뗩 commands in order not to experience sufferings, as 랑e must disobey ourselves; and it is in this disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God consists ( Melville 53), 럭뵫igher the top of that delight than the bottom of the woe is deep (Melville 60). Melville rejects the idea of original sin. It means that everyone on earth is perverted to the original sin that arose from Adam and Eve뗩 expulsion from Eden. Atonement can be deserved by God뗩 grace and needs obedience to God뗩 anger (Talley 55). The main character of the priest뗩 sermon wants to escape God뗩 commands by escaping from any country, where God may watch the people뗩 doings, 라 ship made by men will carry him into countries where God does not reign (Melville 54). He feels fear for God뗩 wrath, which he can call down, I fear the Lord the God of Heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land! (Melville 57). Finally, Jonah accepts the situation, For sinful as he is, Jonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance. He feels that his dreadful punishment is just. He leaves all his deliverance to God, contenting himself with this, that spite of all his pains and pangs, he will still look towards His holy temple (Melville 58).\\n\\nAt the end of the sermon the priest tries to put people to the straight and narrow, 랎his is that other lesson; and woe to that pilot of the living God who slights it. Woe to him whom this world charms from Gospel duty! Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God has brewed them into a gale! Woe to him who seeks to please rather than to appall! Woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness! Woe to him who, in this world, courts not dishonor! Woe to him who would not be true, even though to be false were salvation! Yea, woe to him who, as the great Pilot Paul has it while preaching to others is himself a castaway! (Melville 59). The character of a priest is used to support thematic and narrative aims, Melville stuffs the story with a sacrificial line of images (priests, altars, Biblical sermons), but the religion is used in the story only to keep the ship crew in order (Tischler 185-186).

       " Document(page_content='Cars are used everyday to get from one place to another. In some places, people depend on cars more than others that live in different parts of the world. However, the reduction of car usage has many advantages the planet would greatly benefit from less pollution, traffic jams would not be as frequent, and people become more healthy as a result.\\n\\nLimiting the use of cars would greatly help the problem of pollution in the world today. In the article written by Elisabeth Rosenthal, In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars, she describes what affects cars have on pollution, \"Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middleclass families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe....Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United states\" Rosenthal. One can clearly see that cars are a major factor in the pollution dilemma that so many people are trying to resolve. Everyone can take a part in the resolution of reducing pollution by depending less on cars and using other modes of transport such as public transportation, biking, or even walking. Some cities are placing enforcements to ban the usage of cars. Paris is an example of one of these locations. The result of the enforcement was that congestion or smog went down 60 percent. This is a great improvement for the city, which is known for having nearrecord pollution. Multiplying these enforcements to other cities would definitely bring down a large percent of the pollution found on Earth. This is benefiting not only the planet, but also the population that lives on the planet by enabling them to breathe healthier air.\\n\\nThe cause of traffic jams is the abundant amount of cars on the road, which could be avoided if less cars were used. Andrew Selsky wrote in his article, Carefree Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota , \"In a program that\\'s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carefree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams\" Selsky. With no cars to clog the streets, a relaxed sentiment took the place of a usually anxious and hurried feeling. Rushhour restrictions were put in act, and have drastically cut traffic. Less honking takes place, and more time is saved in order to get to one\\'s destination. Cars are not always needed to get someone where they want to go, and the enviornment is less stressul without all of the congestion of cars on the road.\\n\\nPeople become more healthy when car usage is limited. Instead of taking a car to get from point A to point B, some people are walking or biking instead. This is a huge benefit to the people that are exercising. Also, in Carefree Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota, it says that parks and sports centers have bloomed throuhout the city of Bogota because of the decreased usage of automobiles. The parks and sport centers help people stay active and healthy.\\n\\nAlthough cars are useful in order to get to one\\'s destination, there are many advantages to cutting back the usage of them. A huge advantage is that pollution would drastically go down. Another is the time and stress saved from less traffic jams. Lastly, people would benefit from the way they are making their lives more healthy.'),\n",

The publication was released in 2016 through Box of Crayons Press. The author and publishers claim that they give 랈anagers practical tools so they can coach in ten minutes or less (Bungay, 2016, p. 1). One major argument that comes up is that silence does not mean lack of knowledge or disrespect. This element has been stresses in some chapters of the book due to the fact that a significant majority of managers often associate silence to some level of disrespect. According to the scholar, many times, silence might also suggest a critical and keen thought process. Notably, the scholar explains that proper coaching would help managers and leaders realize such situations and help in the growth of both the junior staff and his or her supervisor.\\n\\nIt can be argued that the author holds a general assumption that coaching only involves the manager. This is due to the fact that significant amount of advice given is directed to the supervisors. The role of the junior staff should also have been explored due to the nature of coaching. He explains that several elements, referred to as question masterclasses are critical for good coaching. The first question, also called the kick start question is critical. The author explains that it is a question 랄n which you discover the power of an opening question that gets the conversation happening fast and deep (Bungay, 2016, p. 36). It can be argued that listening is a key element of any type of coaching. This can be linked to various studies that have been done on the same topic. Bungay (2016) uses this as his conclusion and it can be debated that it sums up the topic well.\\n\\nReference\\n\\nBungay S. M. (2016).

This is only because you are new at the forum so I am inclined to offer extra help as a one time deal. Here is an additional assessment of your essay.  \\n  \\nMost of the work in the Task 1 essay comes in the overview presentation. What you presented is severely lacking in details which is why it will result in a lower TA score for your essay. An effective overview summary, for this type of pie chart contains the following information:  \\n  \\n1. Topic for discussion  \\n2. Enumeration of pertinent data  \\n3.

Whenever necessary, I will be making comparisons to the information while presenting pertinent data coming from the pie charts. What is noticeable from the initial analysis of the charts, is that most of the expenses, regardless of year, goes to paying the teachers salaries.*  \\n  \\nThe above presentation accomplishes 3 things immediately:  \\n1. It tells the reader what the pie charts are about (assuming the reader has no access to the chart)  \\n2.

While 3 sentences is the minimum requirement for the paragraph consideration, writing the maximum of 5 sentences gives you the opportunity to show off your GRA and LR skills.

The video has elements of satire but also many genuine aspects as well. To start off, it is art, and I think is open to interpretation. but my read on the bound 2 video is a bit of love youfuck-you to commercial audiences. With his album being more challenging to audiences than his much of his previous work and a growing misinterpretation by general audiences of the type of artist he is, Kanye served up the most conventionalfun song on the album with a video that both indulges in and skewers many classic americana tropes. The loner on the highway with his girl, horses, rivers, canyons, big sky, flannel (notice the flannel within flannel outfit, symbolic) and others are all symbolic of trying emotionally to meet his resistant audience all the way, while subverting the context of those symbols by placing himself and his fiance into them and essentially simulating a foreplaysexorgasm as the visually allegorical narrative. The video also continues the low-fihigh-tech production theme started on the albums first video \"Black Skinhead\" by being a video that could be completely created in a small studio with simple, wide-spread, compositing techniques. There is also some genuine love in the video as it is between a recently engaged couple who just had their first child, just to put it in context. The video was also instantly a cultural touchstone so for all the hate, it obviously touched some nerve, and that is really the intent overall. Also, it is obvious now that you are trolling.'),\n",

Source 4 says, \"If the pattern persits and many sociologists believe it will it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America\\'s emissions.\" This shows that if you cut out some of your car usage there will be less carbon in the air.

Source 3 says, \"It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.\" The person who said this was talking about the car free day that occurs in Colombia. Going just one day without your car can have an impact on the carbon emissions and help bring down the amount of air pollution in that area.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is new community set ups. Source 1 says, \"But it\\'s basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.\" This shows that the government is willing to set up the community in a different way to limit the amount of car usage on a daily basis. Which also makes your shopping trips more convinant because the stores you need or want to go to are walking distance from your house. Source 3 says, \"Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

Leadership qualities evoke a modification of behavior in other people. It produces a positive reinforcement to people뗩 ideas and performance. It occurs due to the positive effects of leadership.

       " Document(page_content='Image splicing is a very common image manipulation technique that is sometimes used for malicious purposes. A splicing detection and localization algorithm usually takes an input image and produces a binary decision indicating whether the input image has been manipulated, and also a segmentation mask that corresponds to the spliced region. Most existing splicing detection and localization pipelines suffer from two main shortcomings: 1) they use handcrafted features that are not robust against subsequent processing (e.g., compression), and 2) each stage of the pipeline is usually optimized independently. In this paper we extend the formulation of the underlying splicing problem to consider two input images, a query image and a potential donor image. Here the task is to estimate the probability that the donor image has been used to splice the query image, and obtain the splicing masks for both the query and donor images. We introduce a novel deep convolutional neural network architecture, called Deep Matching and Validation Network (DMVN), which simultaneously localizes and detects image splicing. The proposed approach does not depend on handcrafted features and uses raw input images to create deep learned representations. Furthermore, the DMVN is end-to-end optimized to produce the probability estimates and the segmentation masks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art splicing detection methods by a large margin in terms of both AUC score and speed.'),\n",

And in an unequal world - such as ours at this time where some nations are considered \"3rd world\" due to poverty or military oppression - developed nations should spread their culture of social security and personal freedom via media. Call it propaganda if you will, as long as it\\'s spread from a nation willing to sacrifice some security of its citizens in order to only spread these views and ideas through non-violent means then I\\'m fine with using the somewhat stained word propaganda. And under that umbrella of mediapropaganda would be things like free markets in order to develop infrastructure, information technology and of course good old culture in the form of music and movies. Also things like allowing for non-profits or charity organisations to operate abroad, or sending engineers and doctors who volunteer to help, things that go on today already. The view is that if a successful empire were to employ these means of spreading their philosophy and way of life, while simultaneously setting an example by avoiding proactive conflict with the world around them, then people in other countries would themselves see that they could strive for something better and eventually that internal friction would turn into revolution. One obvious flaw with this is as I\\'ve mentioned that any attack against this supposed empire would most likely meet with unprepared defences. I understand that this might seem a pipe dream but I\\'m not asking for this view to be proven impossible but rather for you to change my view on why this shouldn\\'t be a goal to strive towards.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Hello, future roommate These past four was hard work was it not? From maintaining grades, tests and quizzes, and not to mention the infamous SAT, it was tough. But we have managed to pull it through. Isn't it amazing how swift four years in high school have flashed by? Before we knew it, we are in search of the right college. Another big leap closer to adulthood, and the start of a journey that will forever leave memorable imprints in our lives. Like you, I chose to spend my exhilarating journey at Baboon College. Before I introduced myself, I would like to congratulate both of us upon our decision of attending Baboon College. Both of us deserve an applause for all the hard works we have been through. I assume that both of us are eager to be studying in a prestigious college like Baboon, and at the same time excited about the challenges that lie ahead. I am sure that you to find that Baboon is the right match for you. However, Baboon is not just a match for me, but Baboon defines the perfect college for me. I can tell you that my decision to attend Baboon is one of the best decisions I have ever made. Decision-making is part of the human nature. Every day we make countless decisions throughout the day. Making the right decision on a critical issue can significantly alter a person's life. My decision to attend Baboon is that decision, a step further towards illustrious knowledge, challenging academics, and the success I seek. I am confident that Baboon is the place where I belong. Researching through colleges after colleges, Baboon had the radiance unlike any other colleges. It boasts a world-class education, diversity among students, and its primary focus on business. To me, discovering Baboon is like gold that I panned from the river. Finding Baboon took a considerable amount of time and work, but the end result is worth the sweat lost in the process. To some, living in the dorm may be a frightening experience to conquer. Family, friends, and teachers agreeably say that I am respectful, responsible, outgoing, friendly, and unique. I believe that these traits are perfect for us as roommates and for the greater community, the Baboon community. As roommates, communication is one of the crucial factors in leading a healthy friendship. Having been in a boarding school for two years, I am confident to say that you will feel comfortable living with me. I am neither a neat freak nor a messy person, and I respect your space the way I respect mine. I can guarantee you that I never cause any disturbances as a roommate, and if you think that there is a problem, I am more than happy to discuss it with you. Furthermore, I am a great listener, and I will always be there for you when you need someone who you could talk to. After all, your roommate is the person who you will be spending the most of the time with. Which is why I believe that good relations should be emphasized and maintained throughout the rest of our year at Baboon. As I type this letter, words can't describe how I eagerly anticipate the moment I nervously walk into the room and seeing you. I am confident that we will get along throughout our four years at Baboon and that our friendship will last eternally.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Social Responsibility and Its Connection to Organizational Performance Research Paper\\n\\nThese days, there are numerous relevant questions in the field of public administration which should be researched thoroughly. One of them regards the connection between social responsibility and organizational performance. The importance of this topic may be explained by the fact that it appears an integral part of business regulation in any sphere. However, it should be admitted that companies frequently make mistakes in this regard. Mehralian et al. (2016) approached this problem and analyzed the influence of corporate social responsibility on organizational performance in the context of the pharmacy industry in Iran. The scientists concluded: that 랍ocial responsibility is significantly associated with the integration of this responsibility into quality management programs (Mehralian et al., 2016, para. 1). Therefore, the necessity to provide an in-depth insight into the topic of social responsibility is evident, as the understanding of this aspect will be beneficial for market development in the long run.\\n\\nProceeding from the assumptions presented earlier, it is essential to estimate the impact of social responsibility on the outcomes and operation of companies more precisely. First of all, in order to pursue this aim, it is vital to analyze social responsibility among businesses in different spheres, government, stakeholders, and society in general. The second step implies an examination of the consequences of social responsibility awareness for business, government, stakeholders, and society. Thirdly, finding new fields where social responsibility should be encouraged will contribute to exploring this topic. In addition, it is assumed to draw the attention of a greater number of stakeholders to this issue. The last objective involves an analysis of contribution to national development. Consequently, the future research paper is intended to improve awareness of the necessity to adhere to social responsibility on different levels.\\n\\nReference\\n\\nMehralian, G., Nazari, J.

       " Document(page_content=\"All throughout middle school and into high school we hear about nature verses nurture, and we have different teachers tell us their different opinions all the time. I believe that although we may inherit different physical attributes from our parents that may make you more athletic or music oriented, but your interactions with your family, friends, and teachers are the ones who really shape your personality. Different interactions with people have helped me aspire to either be a psychologist or a teacher. Family is by far the biggest factor in my personality. Family is everything, whether you consider your family to be mom and dad, relatives, friends, or a mentor, everyone has a family of some sort. My family consists of me, my mom, dad, and sister. Although we have a large extended family as well, I only see them at holidays and birthdays. The person that I am most like in my family is my mom. She has such a strong personality and is a very compassionate person. One of the biggest things that my mom always does is look for the good in people. The last two years my dad struggled a lot with addiction, and it caused my parents to separate and even after everything that happened, my mom still got my dad to go to counseling and tried to help him overcome all of his problems. My mom's willingness to help my dad even after everything that had happened inspired me to possibly go into psychology. In attempt to further explore psychology I decided to take social psychology this year with my teacher Mrs. Willems. That class is definitely one of my favorite classes. Taking this class has really intrigued me about the human mind and why we have the reactions that we do. During class, we always have different activities like the selective attention test and every day I would come home and show my family the videos we watched and do some of the different experiments we did as well. I couldn't wait to tell my family about what I learned in that class. Another teacher who has helped shaped my goals and aspirations is my fifth and seventh grade teacher, Miss. Canning. She was one of the few teachers that actually cared about her students and tried to make a difference in each of their lives both in an academic level and on a personal level. She made me actually enjoy school and is the one person who changed my opinion about teachers. Furthermore, she made me think about possibly becoming a teacher in the future. My world around me has shaped me into the person I am today and has helped shape my dreams and aspirations dramatically. Without meeting different people in my life, my dreams would be completely different from what they are now. I am so glad I have had different experiences that have shaped my dreams for a career around either being a psychologist or a teacher, and I hope I continue to have more experiences and meet more people who will help me make the right decision on which career to choose.\"),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"Argentina struggled through a lengthy recession lasting from , during which time the nation saw revenues plummet while spending soared. The Argentinian government repeatedly took out loans to cover its deficits, but in 2002 decided to default on over 100 billion of its loans, determining it a better idea to anger foreign investors than to pay skyrocketing interest rates. The default caused inflation at a slightly unhealthy rate, but strong growth in the 2000s made up for this. Argentina faced crisis again in the last several years, its economy slowing quite a bit amidst the global recession. The Argentinian government wanted to take out new loans, and to reduce the interest rates on the loans it'd taken out since 2002, so it approached the owners of the 100 billion in debt on which Argentina defaulted, and offered them a deal: drop their complaints about Argentina's default, and Argentina would repay them 30 cents for each dollar they had loaned out. The vast majority of debt-holders took the deal, seeing it as a way to regain some capital, and a way to help out the Argentinian government. A small group of debt-holders refused, though, comprised almost entirely of American hedge-funds unwilling to surrender an opportunity for profit. These hedge-funds have repeatedly sued Argentina in US courts, and have even sought to have Argentinian property impounded (including a warship in Ghana). Argentina needed every default debt-holder to agree to the 30 cents on the dollar in order for Argentina to be able to take out new debt, and in order for Argentina to be able to get its interest rates down. Argentina's inability to convince the final hold-outs left it with an inability to take out new debt, and an inability to pay interest on its remaining debt. So, once again, Argentina defaulted, telling many more investors that it would not be honoring its debt. This has caused a significant economic blow in Argentina, where many foreign firms are pulling out due to the Argentinian government's apparent unreliability.\"),\n",

Truly the most tragic figure in modern popular culture, Waldo encapsulates the existential craving that plagues us all: Our desire to be found. But Waldo is also trapped in an ironic quagmire of Twilight Zone proportions: Everyone wants to find out where Waldo is, but no one wants to find out who Waldo is. The former is all well and good for us, but without the latter, without that second meaning of being found, Waldo will always be lost. Where is Waldo? Waldo is everywhere. He\\'s at the beach, on the streets of Paris, at the football game, and in the parade. Waldo travels across the globe, hoping his nomadic wanderings will one day allow him to find himself, to discover who he really is. But whether in Britain, Mexico, or Germany, the question is still, \"Where\\'s Waldo? Dance ESAA Waldo? To is Waldo?\" No one ever considers those equally alliterative interrogatives: \"Who\\'s Waldo? Why Waldo?\" And so, once we\\'ve spotted him, we continue on satisfied, never pondering further on the man behind the black spectacles. Waldo\\'s identity crisis drives his every action. Why wear that garish sweater if not to scream, \"Notice me, find me! I am Waldo, and I am here!\" For without it, what\\'s to distinguish Waldo from the endless crowd of nameless pedestrians that surround him? The poor guy can\\'t even decide on a name: He\\'s Waldo in America, Wally in Italy, Willy in Norway, and, inexplicably, Charlie in France. Perhaps he thought, \"Yes, the \\'W\\' was what was holding me back. This time, it will be different,\" but once again his efforts were futile. So he packs his bags full of striped apparel and heads off to find his next crowd. Where is Waldo? Waldo is nowhere. For how can one who is unfound even be certain to exist? Waldo is trapped in a Schr칬dinger experiment, oscillating somewhere between life and death until he is finally observed, collapsing his red and white wave function into a sweater and bobble hat. Yet even once we see Waldo, we do not truly know Waldo, and so he remains doomed to disappear into the crowd once again at the next flip of the page. Perhaps Waldo is a reminder for us to look past the superficial appearances of those we meet and focus instead on character and personality. Perhaps he is a warning that we mustn\\'t depend on others to decide our identities, that we must forge our own path and create our own purpose in life. Either way, the message is clear: Don\\'t end up like Waldo.'),\n",

The food is hit or miss so order carefully. The sweet onion flat bread and pork belly appetizer dish were both great and super as a combination but some of the dishes are just bad combination of flavors. Also, twice I have gone in and the entire place smelled like 5 day old fish they cooked anyway. No restaurant should smell like that. They have a robust evening crowd especially on Friday and Saturday and the outdoor seating is nice. Unfortunately, the waiters tend to forget about you. The last time I visited I asked to be reseated mid-meal because although it was not a busy night, they sat a couple both drenched in very strong fragrance, next to me. Not only does fragrance interfere with the taste of food, but it give me migraines. I excused myself to go to the ladies room and explained to the hostess I did not wish to cause a scene or to offend the new diners and asked if I could be discretely reseated inside that way the other diners would just think it was too chilly for us. She did so graciously but to my great surprise our waiter had a hissy fit. We sat and sat and sat and sat. I had already dropped a few bills on wine and half a meal but couldn't finish it for lack of service. It's sad to say but I handled the situation with tact, Vintner Grill did not. There are way too many good restaurants within a short distance to waste your time on Vintners Grill if you are a foodie. Overall, I think if you not experienced with fine dining or just happy with kind of average stuff and want a place that is a pick-up joint for the beautiful people you would like the crowd and the food.

       " Document(page_content='Starbucks Corporation뗩 Balance Sheet Analysis Essay\\n\\nThe company뗩 assets peaked in 2018, as did net income and revenue. However, the increase is mainly due to a change in the long-term debt indicator, which more than tripled ( Starbucks Corporation , 2021). After 2018, the company뗩 current ratio became negative, which affects its liquidity and ability to pay off short-term liabilities. The company corrected the situation in 2020; however, there is no confident forecast for the future in this case for some reason. Firstly, Starbucks has already quite widely realized its potential, and therefore, huge investments, projects, or financial injections are not expected. Second, the significantly increased long-term debt in 2018 disrupted its relationship with the available capital quite noticeably, increasing it by several whole units.\\n\\nThe importance of determining such indicators in the dynamics of the ratio of short-term and long-term assets and liabilities determines the company뗩 attractiveness for investors. Moreover, high or at least close to one indicator demonstrates the effectiveness of the company뗩 internal processes that manage assets and finances. Ideally, the company should be able not only to deal with short-term obligations confidently but also to have a strategy for the future, which sooner or later will reduce all debt obligations.\\n\\nCompared to competitors, Starbucks and McDonald뗩 have about the same picture: the company copes with short-term liabilities, which shows the current ratio is more than one, and the quick ratio is close to one. However, long-term liabilities will be more difficult for companies to cope with since both of them have significantly increased debt ( McDonald뗩 Cash Flow Statement 2005-2021 | MCD , 2021). JM Smucker or Dunkin Donuts does better in the long run but much worse in the short run ( J M Smucker Cash Flow Statement 2005-2021 | SJM, 2021).

       " Document(page_content='~~396 words~~Movies have always had an exceptional impact on my life. They give us a false sense of reality through fabricated truths about love, social norms, and intensified violence. Movies make us believe the lie, the impossible. Movies give me something to dream about at night and wake me up at 4 AM to watch the last scene just one more time. The Film that changed my perspective about living life, in general, was The Wolf of Wall Street, based on a true story this film has everything a person can ask for. A Three-hour-long sequence of brilliantly processed and refined clips of a stockbroker in New York struggling through life to make his way to achieve the American dream. All this guy wants is money. The film shows the consequences of excess. The character clearly points out that \"I live this lavish life and I make sure my workers see it because I want them to aspire to the life I have, it drives them.\" In the same sense, this movie drives its audience. When I saw the first-half of the movie, it made me want to start a company myself for real. In this movie the antagonist is the bad guy, he steals the money from others and puts it in his pocket but despite his contemptible behavior, the viewer and I still want him to succeed. Perhaps it\\'s the innate human propensity to live vicariously through others. He is doing the wrong thing, but this masterpiece shows that success is more important than the way of achieving it. The movie shows the real grind and the proves that \"if you want something, and you are not born with it, then you can work for it to get it\" It shows how even the impossible can be achieved only if you put your heart and soul into building something. In the final shot, the movie holds up a mirror to its audience by showing a bunch of average people, hopelessly searching for answers. At this moment, all the complicated feelings the viewer has about antagonist are redirected back at the viewers themselves, because by consuming the movie, we put money in the pockets of the man who went to jail for stealing their money. As always, humans did no scams of any sort but experienced everything by nothing else but a motion picture.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Labeling in Psychology: Pros and Cons Essay\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n 1. Pros of Labeling in Psychology\\n 2. Cons of Labeling in Psychology\\n 3. Conclusions\\n 4. References\\n\\nLabeling is a term often used for associating certain people with certain traits. Labels are useful tools in modern society, as they ease communication and save time that would have been spent on needless explanations. In psychology, many specialists utilize specific terms to describe a patient뗩 diagnosis, which is considered 딻abeling. The purpose of this paper is to review the positive and negative aspects of labeling in psychology and medicine and general.\\n\\nPros of Labeling in Psychology\\n\\nThe most important positive aspect of labeling is related to the accuracy of diagnosing as well as the availability and effectiveness of treatment (Elliot & Grigorenko, 2011). The ease of communication between professionals is necessary when facilitating a professional dialogue and developing new ways of psychological treatment. Lastly, using labels may empower the patients and their parents to do research on their own and learn ways of coping and treating the disease (Hinshaw & Scheffler, 2014).\\n\\nCons of Labeling in Psychology\\n\\nWhile labeling is a necessary part of the diagnostic process, it is associated with several negative implications. A label is, for all means and purposes, an approximation of a person뗩 actual condition. This generalization can make psychologists lose sight of some of the personal issues unique to each particular patient (Hinshaw & Scheffler, 2014). Diagnoses also tend to be limited in ways they treat other symptoms found in a patient  many psychologists tend to ignore any signs uncommon to a particular diagnosis, writing them off as a patient뗩 quirks (Mueller, Fuermaier, Koerts, & Tucha, 2012). Lastly, in many societies labeling leads to stigmatization and self-fulfillment, as many patients start perceiving themselves through the lens of their diagnosis (Blais & Forth, 2014).\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nWhile labeling carries plenty of negative connotations in medical science, it is considered a necessary evil. Developing more personalized ways of treating and diagnosing people without labeling them could reduce some of the negative effects mentioned in this paper.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nBlais, J., & Forth, A.

The schools needed this technology to identify the emotional expressions of the students. Sometime things happen in school that the teachers don\\'t know about; they don\\'t know how their students are feeling. There are three benefitile about this technology. The Facial Action Coding System help the teachers identify the emotion of their students. The second is, it really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much the computer can do. The third is, it will help you tell if the person that is the most important to you is sad or happy.\\n\\nThe first reason is the Facial Action Coding System is valuable because it help the teachers identify the emotion of their student. It said in the article \"a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored\". Some of the students in the school won\\'t talk about how they are feeling in the classroom, and some of them would be scared to ask question when they are confused. The new technology would help the teachers so much on how to find out if their students are understanding the works they did in the classroom.\\n\\nThe second is, it really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much the computer can do. Imagine a computer that knows when you\\'re happy or sad. Everybody in this world needs someone that could tell if they were happy or sad, so they would feel like someone is understanding them at lest. \" Eckman has classified six basic emotions; happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness\". These are the great things Eckman has classified that can help us and make us smile.\\n\\nThe third is, it will help you tell if the person that is the most important to you is sad or happy. Sometime we can tell that the person is happy or sad, but we can\\'t not tell it all the time. We can makes the wrong assumption about a person by the look on their face.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System is very valuable to read the emotional expressions of the students in a classroom. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. So we need the new technology to help telling us about a person feeling.

You may want to reflect on your ideas about student responsibility, academic integrity, campus citizenship or a call to service. As I left the Slovakian school for the last time that week, I couldn\\'t help but smile at the words written in chalk on the tar road: \"Goodbye Heidelberg, we are miss you.\" The English wasn\\'t perfect, but I knew what the writer wished to convey. The Slovakian school children would miss all of us from Heidelberg, Germany, and we would miss them. Since that day in Slovakia, I have been transformed forever, and hope to motivate fellow, future University of Florida students into accepting a call to service based on my experience. Living overseas, I have been blessed with the opportunity to live in the Netherlands, Italy, and Germany; therefore, I have been granted the privilege to travel short distances and become immersed in a wide array of countries and cultures. Though I have visited over ten European countries, I will always remember how Slovakia changed the way I perceive the differences in our world. During spring break of my freshman year, I went on a mission trip to Slovakia with my community\\'s Christian youth group. We had sacrificed our vacation to visit and assist in renovating a Slovakian school. Upon our arrival, the school children were overly excited because they had never met Americans, and couldn\\'t wait for the new playground we would be constructing. Throughout the week, I helped construct the playground, shared the Bible, sang, danced, and taught English to the schoolchildren. Growing closer to the children, I became amazed at the happy demeanor they had in spite of their few material belongings; many children wore the same clothes every day. Their school didn\\'t own a single computer or television, and one girl\\'s teeth were rotting due to lack of dental care. I was baffled at how economically different Slovakia was from other countries I have lived in and visited. Slovakia\\'s people have opened my eyes to the differences which exist in the world, as well as the common ground that can be bridged through openness and understanding. Not well-off economically, Slovakian\\'s still find happiness in the simple things of life. For the first time I truly saw that family, relationships, and economic security-not excess-were enough. Slovakian\\'s may not be wealthier than other countries, but they are content with what they have. In these times of economic recession and high unemployment in our own country, I have learned that we should be more like Slovakians-content with what we have and those who surround us with love, rather than excess. I will take my experience in Slovakia as a memory to fall back on during my time at OF, and will challenge my fellow OF students to also take that first step up the staircase of service; the hardest part is to volunteer and go through with it, but the rewards are immeasurable. Once they take this step, I am certain they will see the world from a different perspective, holding memories that will mold them into positive contributors of society.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Innovation and Diversity: Making Co-Existence Productive Essay\\n\\nOrganization of any workplace is a complicated process with numerous ambiguities and challenges. One of common issues in the workplace is diversity, which is commonly associated with both benefits and drawbacks. It becomes even more difficult to cope with it in case of seeking ways to introduce innovations and make diversity and innovations work together to benefit a company and help it to provide additional competitive advantages. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the connection between innovation and diversity in order to make their co-existence productive.\\n\\nTo begin with, it is essential to understand what is diversity and how it is managed. The author of the article teaches that, in general terms, the concept stands for differences in ethnicities, genders, ages, languages, lifestyles, and other critical characteristics of employees. Such a combination is commonly associated with increased risks faced by a diverse organization, such as higher turnover rates, poor social integration, higher prevalence of interpersonal conflicts, lower levels of attachment and commitment to work, and communication problems. Because of them, it is paramount to create suitable conditions in the workplace, which would eliminate the risks mentioned above and foster the unity of and mutual understanding between members of diverse teams.\\n\\nKeeping in mind all of the identified issues and risks, the major challenge is to properly integrate people with varying background in one working environment and make them an effective team. The author of the article believes that to achieve it, the main objective is to develop efficient human resource management practices. It is assumed that managers should make the main focus on personal styles, work preferences, perception of risks, and commitment to work.\\n\\nFinding the right balance between all of these characteristics is one of the ways to create a diverse and, at the same time, effective team. On the other hand, it is an optimal way of organizing work routines due to fostering integration of people with differing backgrounds but similar values. All in all, the combination of these techniques leads to turning into a high-commitment organization, which benefits both management and people. As a result, teams become not only effective but also more creative.\\n\\nStill, it is of significant importance to understand the connection between diversity, creativity, innovations, and competitive advantage. According to the author of the article, it is creativity that is the foundation of innovations. However, regardless of the simplicity of this statement, it is often complicated to define creativity because it can be viewed from different perspectives  person, product, processes, and environment.\\n\\nIt is the creativity of processes that leads to innovations, and processes turn into more creative by the involvement of people with diverse backgrounds in one environment. As a result, processes become more innovative, which leads to becoming more competitive  gaining additional advantages.\\n\\nThat being said, the author of the article teaches three important lessons. First and foremost, regardless of potential risks and drawbacks, diversity is a positive phenomenon. However, to maximize its benefits, it is critical to develop and deploy relevant human resource management techniques, such as creating effective diverse teams and organizing work routines. It is the second thing learned from the article. Finally, in case of succeeding in appropriate management, diversity becomes the source of additional competitive advantages because it boosts creativity, which is the main source of innovations.\\n'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Business Law Violation: Jettison and Big Ben Inc. Report (Assessment)\\n\\nThe study of business law is a rather challenging task due to several reasons. First of all, the complexity of human relations has always been difficult to adjust to and it is hard to find out who is right or wrong in a certain dispute. Moreover, every human being defends his/her interests, especially in the area of business, and the principles of the business law should be as precise and fair as possible to be able to settle any dispute on any subject possible. That is why the following cases demand precise answers as to the rights of parties in their controversy with each other.\\n\\nFirst of all, the controversial situation involving Jettison and BigBen Inc. should be considered. The matter of this case is the inability of the latter company to pay its debt to the former one. Moreover, BigBen Inc. offers a rather complicated way of solving the issue, i. e. Jettison뗩 ability to collect the debts from those who owe money to BigBen Inc. This case is rather controversial as only the formally correct agreement between BigBen Inc. and its indebted customers, if provided to Jettison with the official permission for collection of the debt, can entrust Jettison with the right to receive its money at least in this way.\\n\\nConcerning the second case involved, the position of Jettison is even less fortunate. The subject matter of the dispute is the lease agreement for the lease of a store for $1000 per month. The problem here is that the owner of the store leased agreed verbally to reduce the rent for $250 per month if allowed to use Jettison뗩 snowmobiles free of charge. However, when the payment term approached, the store owner demanded the full payment although he used the snowmobile option. In this case, it is almost impossible to defend Jettison뗩 right in court as the verbal agreement cannot be proved to have ever been concluded unless specific witnesses are present to testify the fact.\\n\\nFurther on, the case involving Sara and her Big Bucks, Inc. position proposal are not that hard to solve. The point is that offering great conditions of employment for the beginner, Big Bucks, Inc. needs the guarantee of Sara뗩 loyalty to the company. It is a natural process for several companies around the globe and Sara should not be taken aback by this. Concerning Kevin and his cyber-deli caf칠 case, there are no reasons for lawful dispute at all. The fact that one of the caf칠뗩 customers choked with a sandwich being prior warned about such a danger leaves no space for controversy. Moreover, the fact that the 랐ictim slapped Kevin in the face adds to his credibility in case of any lawsuit the customer might file.\\n\\nThus, it is evident that the business law provides rather clear and precise guidelines as to how various disputes might be solved. Thus, official notarized documents provide the parties concerned with legislative protection while the mere verbal agreements not supported by evidence do not. At the same time, there is a need for people to be aware of the basics of business law so that to perceive the job offers or lawsuit threats adequately and not to be misguided in any case.\\n'),\n",

How has your family history, culture or environment influenced who you are today? 1. Leaving my native country, England, to migrate to the United States was definitely an obstacle that would change me as a person. My parents had planned for me to migrate to the \"Land of dreams\" to experience a better way of life than one offered in Great Britain. One of the opportunities my parents wanted me to have been to receive an education in the American Collegiate educational system that will be beneficial to my future as an adult. I will be the first generation in my family to attend College, let alone an American College. I had assumed leaving my family and childhood friends would be difficult but in fact, it has been the most agonizing thing I have done in all my life. Furthermore, I remember my Mothers face as I waved goodbye through the crowded lines of travelers and made my way to the British Airways Airport gate... Nevertheless, these obstacles have forced me to grow into a better person. I have evolved into a hardworking, mature young woman as I have progressed academically and courageously. Not only have I had to adjust to a very different society, I also had to grow as a spirit in order to avoid being feeble and losing all willpower for success. Many times I have thought to return to England because I was so emotionally drained, but I knew that I would disappoint myself and my parents, who have put so much effort into giving me the opportunities I have today. 2. Whether it is school work or competing with my friends in a race, I have always been known to enthusiastically work to my full potential. I owe this all to my family. Born and raised in England, I grew up in a Caribbean household. My Mother, who was raised in Antigua, had to work from a young age on her native island executing agricultural labor such as herding cows and fetching water from the local well every morning. My Father, bought up in Jamaica, had to act out similar agricultural duties such as harvesting crops to provide food for the family. For this and other reasons, I can say my parents have always been the perfect role models throughout my childhood showing me what it is to be a hardworking person. They taught me and my siblings that if you want something, you have to work for it; that saying has always stuck with me as I progressed through life. My family also taught me that you should always have respect for others and to be polite, as well as to always stand up for what you believe in. My family\\'s strong cultural background has constantly played a role in my self values and beliefs, as well as my determined passion to be diligent to gain success. Growing up in a family full of passionate, persevering individuals has definitely inspired me to work to my full ability and inject everything I have into my efforts.'),\n",

As I laughed them off, I told them it's my title for the rest of my life, and then I brought up how angry would you be if your parents named you after Budweiser or something silly. Then I brought up the question; if you can name yourself, what name would you take? As their smiling faces turned blank, they finally understood my dilemma. With the citizenship forms due within the week, I sought out to pick the perfect name. What would go well with Zhang, and what name could fit me? Unable to find a name, I decided whoever in history I admired the most; I will take his first name. As I finalized my potential names: Otto (Bismarck), Theodore (Roosevelt), George (Washington), and Alexander (the Great); eventually, Theodore was the last name on the list. Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th President of the United States, was more than a man; his list of achievements is comparable to characters in fictional novels. I admire his love for sports and how he didn't let his asthma affect his love for sports. Likewise, I am hindered physically when I played football, being the smallest linebacker, I struggled to face lineman. Although I was the smallest, I didn't allow it to stop me; I learned tricks to deal with them: attack lower, to one side and quickly. Through dedication and experience I overcame my limiting factor, and I began to view lineman as clumsy and slow. Besides athletics, Roosevelt was known for his bravery and patriotism. When the Spanish-American War broke out, Roosevelt immediately quit his job as the Secretary of the Navy and started his a volunteer regiment. His regiment, Rough Riders, would become famous for the Charge of San Juan, and he was posthumous awarded the Medal of Honor for his bravery. His bravery is indescribable, and I admire the way he defended his nation during conflict displaying his patriotism and courage. I hope I can emulate his bravery by carrying myself to higher standards, by not shying away from difficult 7 and do things that are not required of me. The best description for Roosevelt is perhaps, manliness. He was the alpha-male of the 20th century. His achievements are unmatched, as he started his life as a rancher; he became an author, an academia, a leader, a war-hero, a sheriff, an explorer and eventually the President. From how Roosevelt lived life to the fullest, taking Roosevelt's first name was the only rational choice to make. As his name may serve as a reminder to carry my life as Roosevelt did in his life, I will do my best to live up to the standards he did: don't let things get in my way and uphold courage. It maybe an overstatement I think I have a man-crush on Theodore Roosevelt.\"),\n",

We are also told the we have the freedom to vote once you reach certain requirements, like age and citizenship. However, are we really getting the freedom that is talked about? No. Because the Electoral College is present in today\\'s society, our vote becomes pointless and meaningless. We become a \"popular\" vote, but really the electoral college gets to decide who becomes presidents. The Electoral College has been in our Constitution since the Constitution was approved, but we have modified simple things as in gender discrimination and race discrimination, why are we not going to change this unjust system?\\n\\nBradford Plumer, author of The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the Bestlaid Defenses of System are Wrong, explains how the electoral college is fooling our citizens to think we have a say in our country\\'s government. He elaborates further to say that \"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. This proves my point further, because once again we do not vote for our president, we vote for the people who get the \"privilege\" to vote for the most prestine place of power in our entire country.\\n\\nThe next problem with our Electoral College is that each state is given an uneven amount of representatives form each state. If Florida voted candidate A, but North Dakota voted for candidate B, candidate A is bound to win because Florida has twentynine representatives and North Dakota only has three. As you can see Mr. President, this becomes a preblem because four states with only three representatives could vote for one candidate, but if Florida votes for the other one, the first candidate has already lost.\\n\\nNow most people are afraid of change, which is understandable. They are afraid chaos will occur if any change with our society\\'s ethics. However, the Electoral College has already caused chaos between the two opposing sides. If we tried a new system, we could see if the people will become more civilized because they now have a say in the government. If it doesn\\'t work, then we can always change it back and no harm will be done. As you can see, there are many possibilities and options we have yet to explore.\\n\\nMr. President, I have explained to you what the people want, which is to stop being lied to.

Our brain does this to protect ourselves, so that, should something bad happen, \"at least we were right to be suspicious!.\" Easy example: your partner has not been answering the phone for the whole day - you don\\'t know why heshe is doing that, so you tend to assume a lot of \"bad\" scenarios (cheating or accidents, for example). Positive experiences, on the other hand, do not involve lack of knowledge. When we remember something pleasant, we always know all that we need to know for that memory to be beautiful. Of course every person has his own way of thinking. There are people who never think negatively simply because they are careless.

Nowadays, in many parts of the world numerous students are facing problems finding themselves an approtiate job after the end of their university education. In my opinion, the lack of research before choosing an university degree, as well as the increasing value of experience are the main factors contributing to this problem.  \\n  \\nAfter graduation school, many students have no idea what to do with their lives. That leads to the moment, when many of them choose to apply for the most popular degrees at the moment, rather than seach for those, which will be valuable and successful for the future. That said, after 5 years of university education, the prevalent part of them realized that they have applied for a degree without proper perspectives for finding a well-paid job. Moreover, in tough economic environment like today\\'s, many employers prefer to not take any risks, and do not assign people without sufficient experience in the job area.  \\n  \\nIf we want to tackle this problem, we should educate our children that what is popular and in demand today, can be out of date tomorrow. Students need to have a vision for the future and apply for degrees that are likely to bring them success in long term. Furthermore, they need to find ways to implement and test the learned material into the real world. It is essential for the students to have experience \"on the field\" and they should be foster by the government to participate in work programs or spend time in a company thorugh different interships.  \\n  \\nIn conclusion, I think that nowadays, the whole process of choosing an university degree is completely wrong. The government and school authorities should provide assistance and incentives to people from the younger generations for choosing degrees, which are going to be valuable and popular in the long-term.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='American History X: Film Analysis Critical Essay\\n\\nFilms as any pieces of art always require their proper evaluation and interpretation according to definite principles of the critical analysis of works. To cope with the task effectively, it is necessary to concentrate on the difference between the main peculiarities of evaluation and interpretation.\\n\\nMoreover, it is also significant to determine the elements which can be discussed in relation to this or that aspects. The factors which can influence the result of the evaluation and interpretation of the film and their specific features can be examined with the help of the study of American History X of 1998.\\n\\nEvaluation of the work of art in general and of the film in particular is the determination of its special significance and worth. Thus, any piece of art can be considered as meaningful and important for the public.\\n\\nTo determine this significance, it is necessary to pay attention to the main idea of the film, to its purpose and conclusions. In its turn, interpretation is the explanation of the meaning of the work of art. Thus, to evaluate the film, it is significant to understand or to interpret the main elements and scenes of the film which can help to assess its worth and the aesthetic significance.\\n\\nThat is why the difference between evaluation and interpretation is in the quality of the analysis which a critic provides in connection with a definite film. Interpretation as an explanation only focuses on the plot meaning of certain elements of the film contributing to its right analysis. While evaluating the work, critics concentrate on the deep meaning of this piece of art which was provided as the artist뗩 main idea.\\n\\nAny film should be discussed from the points of interpretation and evaluation. It is important to accentuate the elements which are required to be interpreted and evaluated in American History X. The evaluation as an approach is necessary for the analysis of the general worth of the film and its significance.\\n\\nThe main director뗩 idea was the discussion of the problems of racism and supremacy in the American society and the depiction of those dangerous effects which can have uncontrolled violent actions of the people who divide the others in 땅hite and 딱lack or other categories.\\n\\nThe aesthetical characteristics of the film are also decisive. Thus, it is required to focus on the details of the film as an aesthetical piece. That is why, to evaluate the worth of the film, critics should assess the importance and currency of the main author뗩 idea and those effects which were used for creating the picture.\\n\\nNevertheless, to make the successful evaluation, it is important to interpret the film perfectly. For instance, it is necessary to concentrate on such aspects depicted in American History X as the reasons for the narrator뗩 writing the report on Mein Kampf by Hitler, the peculiarities of Denny뗩 description of his brother Derek and causes for the fact that Danny idealizes his brother, the causes for Derek뗩 popularity among the youth, and the causes for Derek뗩 intention to prevent his brother from entering the supremacist뗩 organization in order to interpret thoroughly (ㄹmerican History X). These details should be discussed in their association with the other aspects which are important for the particular analysis of the film.\\n\\nThe last scenes of the film can be considered as the most meaningful in the film. Thus, critics can concentrate on the details of Danny뗩 essay and his vision of the brother, Derek뗩 attitude to the situation with 땅hite and 딱lack in the society and his feelings toward Danny (ㄹmerican History X).\\n\\nEvaluation and interpretation are the necessary parts of the analysis of the work of art which help to understand its meaning and assess the aesthetic and cultural significance.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nAmerican History X.

Specially trained officers will begin carrying the stun weapons over the next few weeks. It brings the Scottish force into line with their counterpart in England, where Tasers have been used since 2011. The weapons are used to incapacitate suspects through the use of an electric current. Temporary Assistant Chief Constable Alun Thomas said: \"This decision is not based on specific intelligence of any criminal behaviour or imminent threat, but will allow us the option to deploy Taser devices where, in the course of their duty, an officer needs to protect the public or themselves by using force. \"The current threat to the UK from international terrorism remains\\'severe\\', meaning an attack is highly likely. \"Recent terrorist attacks across the world are a stark reminder that the threat from terrorism is a genuine risk, and it is important that we keep our security measures and operational tactics under constant review.\" Officers south of the border fired the Tasers eight times during 2015, according to a reply to recent Freedom of Information request to the force. In one instance, police used a weapon against a man armed with a large knife - a move which \"undoubtedly\" prevented people from being hurt, according to Mr Thomas. He said: \"In our assessment, the introduction of Taser devices in Scotland is a proportionate response and provides an additional option for our officers to consider when confronted with a genuine threat to themselves or the public. \"By way of example, in December last year, police deployed a Taser device against a man armed with a large bladed knife, preventing him cutting the throat of stranger who he had targeted at random at Leytonstone station, east London. \"Undoubtedly the use of the Taser device in this incident prevented even further harm to the travelling public.\" \"We believe that the public in Scotland deserve the same level of protection as people elsewhere on the rail network.\" British Transport Police said they reached the decision on Tasers following \"detailed discussions\" with Police Scotland. Scottish Ministers have also been briefed. The force refused to reveal how many officers would receive the training required to carry Tasers \"for security reasons.\" Ch Supt John McBride, divisional commander for the Scotland, said Taser use by officers would be monitored. \"Every time we unholster it, it will be subject to review,\" he told the BBC\\'s Good Morning Scotland programme. \"It will be subject to internal review by our own specialists, but also we have agreed with the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner that where there is a discharge and serious incidents involving Taser then we will refer ourselves to the Pirc for them to review the circumstances of the case and if necessary carry out an investigation.\"'),\n",

Dear Young 'UN, I know you feel you know everything and do not need anyone's advice, but they will not admit me into college if I do not post this. So here is some unsolicited advice that will hopefully make your journey through high school a little more enjoyable. (i) Drugs, drinks, and cigarettes bring only ephemeral pleasure. Respect your body, and avoid them like the plague. (ii) They say you are the average of your seven closest friends. Surround yourself with good people and pick up their best practices. (iii) High school drama is just that. In a few years, most of it will be forgotten. (iv) If you want something awful, go for it like a madman. Wake up at 5 am for cricket practice, spend late nights preparing for math Olympiads, travel across town to take acting lessons. A hard day's night brings sweet dreams. (v) Do not procrastinate - learn to structure your time. At the same time, have patience and learn to enjoy putting time and effort into your work. (vi) There is no shame in asking for help. Most of your friends will be going through the same changes in life as you. (vii) Be true to your teeth, or they will be false to you. I have had four cavities filled over the past two years due to stupid soft drinks - do not let this happen to you! Either give up sugar-rich foods, or start flossing. (viii) Most importantly, MINE LITECOIN! Bitcoins can only be mined by expensive ASICs, but there is still hope. Right now Lite coins are going for about $8 a coin, so even if you make five coins every month, you would be richer by $40. If you are tempted to cash out when they hit $10 or $20, DON'T! Look me up after four years and send across a couple of million dollars to your visionary well-wisher. Write to Ashoka University, and let them know how I have selflessly taken time out of my busy schedule to help an up-and-coming student like yourself. Hopefully your new friend, Shlok Gilda\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Changing Education Paradigms Video by The RSA Essay\\n\\nChanging Education Paradigms addresses the topic of a fundamental review of the approach to education, and I strongly support the ideas expressed therein. Patel offers reasonable criticism of 라 system of education that is modeled on the interests of industrialism and in the image of it (as cited in The RSA, 2012). The main drawback of this approach to children뗩 education is the conveyorized and standardized approach to the mechanisms of students information perception. Thus, the current major issue in this area is the development of an individualized and flexible education system that takes into account the personal characteristics of learning processes.\\n\\nThere is no doubt that every individual should have the right to any kind of education. Based on the initial thinking characteristics of children, parents should be able to select the type of learning for them. Students with an analytical mindset could be successful in classical academic education, and specialized learning might suit better to people with applied thinking. At the same time, society should abandon the division of people into two types: academic and non-academic (The RSA, 2012). Firstly, it stigmatizes people with non-analytical thinking, and secondly, it is merely inadequate since the mindset types are highly diverse, not dyadic.\\n\\nIt should be noted that the distribution of responsibilities between the levels of government in the United States in the field of education is not always effective. According to Theodoulou and Kofinis (2012), 랎he decentralization of education underscores socioeconomic and cultural differences from state to state (Chapter 9 Summary, para. 12). Nevertheless, the national education standard should be established at the federal level. In that regard, the NCLB Act of 2002 played a positive role in improving the quality of education, as it made 랍tudents, teachers, schools, and districts accountable (2012, Chapter 9 Summary, para. 8).\\n\\nThis legislation had the function of improving the average level of education and giving more children the right to education. However, the national quality standard does not take into account the individual characteristics of local students. It is my understanding that the provision of concrete education should be addressed through the development of specific educational institutions by individual citizens, who take into account the demand for different types of learning. Thus, the selection of curricula for specific children with individual needs should be made at the level of a particular school or other educational institution.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nThe RSA. (2010).

       " Document(page_content='At many times in my life, I\\'ve had leadership opportunities thrown at me. There have been opportunities to do the right thing, to take charge and stand in the limelight, and then there have been times to work behind the scenes. Everyone likes recognition for their actions every once in a while, but sometimes I think it is even better to work behind the scenes and go unnoticed in your hard work. Instead of broadcasting good works, I think it is most important to do what is right and be a leader behind closed doors. The reward is most often not physically present but rather the feeling of accomplishment fills your whole heart. This quality in me has been very evident the past two years on my high school tennis team. I am the captain of my team and I took this role as the responsibility to take care of all the girls. I knew our team would have far from a winning season, and it was my job to make sure each girl got better at tennis and had fun while doing it. To ensure a memorable season, I spent time in the summer organizing practices, getting to know the girls, and making personalized locker decorations for everyone to feel special about for the upcoming school year. After the start of the season, I made it a point to learn each girl\\'s name and say hello to them during the school day. Although I never received some kind of award or recognition for these actions, I know that they had a positive effect on the girls. I was a leader for them by just doing the simple, unnoticed things and even though the record books didn\\'t show it, I believe every girl had a successful season. Another opportunity I had to work behind the scenes was for my high school\\'s junior prom. Our theme was Wizard of Oz and immediately all the girls seemed excited to get planning and building props for the fast approaching date. However, as the big day got closer, people got less and less motivated. By the time there were two weeks left to plan, my class still had done nothing. There was no one to get people going and no one to devote themselves to the project. I knew this was my shot to do something important even if it meant sacrificing a lot of my own time. I worked for hours and hours organizing people to cut, paint, and build all the props. When the night arrived juniors, parents, and community members raved on how beautiful the set looked. My name wasn\\'t written across tornado, or the wicked witch, or the flying monkeys to show that it was my work, but the feeling of accomplishment for myself was enough. I knew I had been the one to step up and work hard and because of that, I had made the night special for everyone there. Mitch Album says in his book The Five People You Meet in Heaven, \"Sometimes when you sacrifice something, you\\'re not really losing it. You\\'re just passing it on to someone else\" (Album). I\\'ve realized that being a leader means sacrificing some things. Whether it\\'s time or money or anything else, sometimes they have to be given up to get things done. But these sacrifices are not losses. They are opportunities to accomplish things and pass them on to others. I know that my actions can affect a lot of people positively even if they are unnoticed, which in turn is a great achievement for me.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Students have projects throughout the whole school year to expand their learning. All of the projects are usually teacher-designed and students are given requirements of what needs to be in their project. A lot of schools have summer projects to keep students engaged in learning over their break. Since teachers design all of the in-school projects, students should design their summer projects. Summer projects should be student-designed because it lets students be more creative, have more freedom, and prepare them for the future.\\n\\nStudents should design their summer projects because it lets them be more creative. Having students be more creative makes it more of a fun time to be learning. They will research things that interests them and they will want to put in the work. They will actually get excited about some of the school work their doing. Summer is a time to have fun and rest. Having to do work assigned by teachers will make students lazy. If students design their projects, they can do research on things they've done during their break also. If something they've done or somewhere they went is what they want to do for there project, then they should be able to be creative and do it. If students are allowed to be more creative, they will almost make it a competition and want to make it better than others. It will make them thing outside the box to come up with something no one else will do. Also, doing a different type of project makes it more challenging which makes them be more creative. If they do a project on something they enjoy, then they will become more creative.\\n\\nSecond, students should design their summer projects because they will have more freedom. Having more freedom motivates students to do their work. If they are more motivated to do it, it will come out better and students will feel better about the work they did. Like said about being creative, if students have more freedom, they will research on something they enjoy and have fun doing it. They will want to do the work which would end up with a better final product. Many students, especially in the summer, will put things off thinking they have all the time in the world, and then it ends up being two days before school starts and they haven't started their project. If they don't have a list of things to do, they will feel like they have more work to do and create their own list of things and do their research, etc. When they know what they have to do, they will procrastinate. When they're kind of lost, they feel like they need to get it started.\\n\\nLast, students should design their summer projects because they will become more prepared for the future. Students will have to work independently because everyone will be doing something different. They wouldn't be able to check in with other people or get the answers, they have to put all the work in themselves. Having no one guiding them prepares them for the future for when they will have to create your own projects all the time. It makes things more challenging and really makes them do all their research and perfect their projects. If they are being challenged, they will get better at doing their projects and make teacher-designed projects easier. They will become less dependent on their teacher and become more trusting in themselves because they can do things on their own. In the future, they won't always have someone to check with and guide them on what their supposed to do.\\n\\nWhile teacher-designed projects keeps students on track and makes it easier for them, students creating their own projects prepares them for their future jobs and college projects, and gives\\xa0them more space to research things they enjoy and find more interesting which motivates them to do the work. If summer-projects are student designed, they will grow up to be more prepared, creative people.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The United States is a democratic country where the people decide on a leader through voting, or so it\\'s supposed to be. We Americans use something called the Electoral College, where a state is worth a certain amount of points, and when you win that state for your party, you gain those points. I find this to be unfair, because you could win by popular vote, but lose because the opposing party won the states with the biggest number of points. I think that the Electoral College should be removed and replaced with popular vote only. It would make elections more fair, and it would make peoples\\' votes feel like they change something.\\n\\nWhen you go to vote, you don\\'t actually vote for the candidate, you vote for a group of people who in turn vote for the candidate. I find this to be ineffective, because the people you are voting for are still able to switch there vote to the other party, and humans aren\\'t the most honest things on Earth. Also, there is the feeling of being important that you get when you think that you could tip the scale, it makes you feel special, and in control of your own country. What\\'s the point of voting if there\\'s a chance it might not matter, because the other party just won California, the state with the most amount of points, 55, and you couldn\\'t do anything because you live in Idaho or North Dakota, with only three little points. Popular vote would make you feel involved, and happy to help.\\n\\nAs I stated before, each state has an amount of points based on the population, which in turn affect how much you help your desired party. Seems reasonable, right? You would think that the more the population, the more impact it has on the election. That\\'s right, but it\\'s also unfair because states that have noone living there could all vote for one party, but it wouldn\\'t help that much, unless the points were close and that state tipped the scale. But big states, like California, Texas, and Florida have some of the most points, so if you were to win those, you already have more than one hundred points. Candidates would try to just seek out those jumbo prizes and systematicaly try to win the largest behind \"the Big Four\". If someone was reading this and wanted the Electoral College, they could say that the big states would still have an advantage with more voters, and that is right, but they wouldn\\'t be as big of prizes. So the election turns from a voice of the people, speaking up for a new leader, and turns into a mad chase to get the biggest prizes before the other party, like a game of Monopoly. In Monopoly, you buy areas with your money, and when someone lands on that space you own, they have to pay you. The places ath the end of the board have the priciest cost, but the best outcome. You can also build property on spaces to make the enemy players pay more. If you were to buy those, you practically win the game. On the other hand, the spaces at the begining are basiclly worthless, costing about 100 dollars and giving you about 1000. Those are like the small states, that have almost no value to the election, and the big states are worth a lot.\\n\\nIn America, the people should be able to feel responsible for their country\\'s future, and not feel as if their state doesn\\'t matter. My own words might not be able to change peoples\\' minds, but I\\'m sure the votes aren\\'t tied.    '),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The Pollution Within: Foreign Substances in the Human Body Analytical Essay\\n\\nAn American writer decides to take a test to determine the level of foreign substances in his body. Laboratory test results indicate that some substances, some of which are used to reduce flammability of materials, are present in his blood. The level of concentration of these compounds is many times higher than the level that would be found in an average American.\\n\\nThe writer says that an average person would not afford to take the tests since they cost more than fifteen thousand United States dollars. His tests are sponsored by National Geographic. He also notes that there are only a few laboratories in the world where one can be tested for the compounds. A high level of concentration of an organic compound of bromine, PBDE, known to cause numerous disorders in rodents, is found in his blood.\\n\\nThe writer wants to know the source of the contaminants in his blood. He speaks to Ake Bergman, a doctor, and together they identify the interior furnishing of airliners as the possible source of the chemicals in his body. The writer continues to describe the nature of the chemicals found in his body.\\n\\nMost of the chemicals are usually found in small doses that are harmless to a human being. Despite these facts, the number of ailments related to toxic contaminants is increasing with time. Very small amounts of some chemicals have a negative effect on the development of an individual.\\n\\nDespite the increasing number of new chemicals being used in industry every year, only a few thousand of them were tested for harmful effects in the United States. The writer recalls one dump he often visited as a child, and describes how it could have played a role in contaminating his blood with the foreign substances. Some chemicals found in his body date back to when he was a child playing at the dumpsite.\\n\\nThe dumpsite has since been cleared and a cleaner environment restored. The writer recounts the pollution of the Hudson River with PCBs and the inevitable consequences the communities living nearby suffered. He then explores the effect of modern pollutants such as bisphenol A, which is found in many modern synthetic materials. Many of the chemicals that the writer considers dangerous are not proven to be dangerous to human beings, but are known to adversely affect other living things.\\n\\nThe ability of mercury to move through food chains after reacting with an organic compound is explained. However, the writer notes that the levels of mercury in his blood were insignificant. Mercury is normally present in fish products from contaminated areas. The writer goes to the extent of investigating the sources of mercury by engaging in a risky behavior while being routinely tested.\\n\\nAlthough some chemicals pose a significant degree of danger to human life, it is not possible to ban their use. Their use is absolutely necessary since failure to incorporate them in some manufacturing processes poses higher risk to human life than trivial contamination of blood.\\n\\nIf substances such as those used to reduce flammability of fabric are not used in some manufacturing processes, more lives could be put in the direct danger presented by events such as accidental infernos. The only solution to the problem is to ensure that the chemicals that people are deliberately exposed to have more benefits than negative effects.\\n\\nThe writer뗩 results show that there are many other foreign substances in his blood. However, the doctor does not know whether they have any adverse effect on his health. Finally, the doctor advises that he should not worry since he did not show any signs of ill health.\\n'),\n",

RSPCA Cymru\\'s Steve Carter said workers faced \"immense demands.\" The charity said the economic downturn was probably still partly to blame with some people unable to look after pets. The 100 conviction rate was up from 97.8. Mr Carter said it demonstrated \"how robust our investigative process is.\" The number of animals rescued or collected also more than doubled, which the charity says is more positive.

Evan Lloyd Evans, 69, was jailed for 10 weeks after being found guilty of multiple animal welfare offences in October 2013. The conditions the horses were kept in were described as \"appalling and completely inappropriate.\" EMACIATED DOGS: In another case, a married couple from Pembrokeshire were banned from keeping dogs for five years after their dogs were found to be so emaciated that one of them - a lurcher - weighed less than a cat. CATS LEFT TO BREED: A mother and daughter from Wrexham who neglected 17 cats in their care were disqualified from keeping all animals indefinitely. The family had left the cats to breed uncontrollably with only one of their cats being neutered. Several, including the two kittens, had to be put to sleep because of their serious health issues. Both women were given community orders. \\'WORST\\' FLEA INFESTATION: A suspended sentence and life ban were given to a Pontypridd man, 55, who had a cat with the worst flea infestation the vet had ever seen. The cat, which was found living in squalid conditions in an upstairs bedroom, recovered. The man had previously been prosecuted by the RSPCA regarding two of his dogs. Source: RSPCA The RSPCA believes the economic downturn could still be playing in part in the increase in cases reported to it, where people are unable to look after pets which in some cases leads to neglect.

       " Document(page_content=\"WOW this place is one of the coolest time warps around! I can't believe I never knew about it! As Norm R. said, this is part of William Bartlett's ranch dating back to 1886 with many original restored structures, some are brick and wood and one is stucco, and they all have that wonderful weathered old look to them that just makes you wonder if these walls could speak, what stories would they tell? You can peek inside the buildings and see the furniture, tools and stuff they used during the pioneer days and get a sense of what life was like in Old West Arizona. You can also wander around the property and look at and even touch (but no climbing please!) lots of cool rusty old farm machinery, wagons and equipment, and wonder about what it was used for. I also saw: a blacksmith shop, a reproduction of a well building that would have been used in the 1920's, something that looked like a locomotive engine, a dairy barn, a cornfield, a citrus orchard, grapevines, a rose garden, peacocks, rooster chasing a hen, the cutest white bunny I've ever seen in my life, and 7 beautiful princesses in ball gowns and tiaras posing for quincenera pictures. All around the property are educational signs with info and photos about the original ranch and what life was like from the 1890's thru the 1930's (when the ranch was at the peak of production). I didn't get a chance to take a tour, but I think that would be an excellent idea! The website says that tours are held Thursdays thru Saturdays, 10 AM - 2 PM, and Sundays 1 - 4 PM. I saw a sign that says you can even rent parts of the property for special events. (I gotta save up for a major shindig now!) It's the perfect spot for an afternoon stroll when it isn't unbearably hot, and there are tons of park benches where you can just rest and relax. If you have kids they will be super happy to see all the cool stuff and run around after the peacocks. Just don't let them climb all over everything or lose them in the cornfield, and you'll be good.

I bought the truck off Craigslist and got ripped off big time. Not only did I have to put 2,000 in repairs to the motor and tranny within not even a week of owning it, I found out after pressing my breaks hard and hearing a loud pop underneath my truck and it pulling hard to the right that my frame was pretty much cracked in half. The seller used bondo and paint to hide it. I took the truck in to 3 different auto collision center's and was turned down by 2 of them and the 3rd one estimated the damage to be at 3,500. I decided to do some more shopping and found some private welderd and was turned down by all 3. One of them recommended I take it to Al. Im glad I did. He put my truck on the lift and checked it over explaing everything in detail. After looking my truck over he said I would need a comple right side frame piece from another truck.

When he showed md the estimate he wrote up I thought there must have been a typo coming in a little over 2,000 less then what the other shop quoted me. Of course I went forward with the repairs I felt real comfortable leaving my truck in his hands. I never felt pressured into anything and I never got the feeling that he was in it for tge money.

       " Document(page_content='The Article Is This the End? by James Atlas Essay\\n\\nAs of now, the development of humankind has reached its highest point in terms of technological capacity and social awareness. Under these circumstances, a false sense of security may arise, supporting the perception of civilization as an eternal entity. More specifically, many experts and researchers state that it deems itself in control of the Earth with all its resources and natural phenomena. Nevertheless, the planet continues to remind us that there exist processes over which modern civilizations have little or no agency. Furthermore, while history is often presented as a chain of logical events, other researchers argue that it is, in fact, a seemingly ordered combination of chaotic occurrences. Archaeological findings often support the second point of view, showing how even the most advanced civilizations of their time perished in the face of irresistible forces.\\n\\nSuch a perspective became central for The New York Times pieces titled Is This the End? In this article, James Atlas (2012) reflects upon the disastrous natural phenomena that shook humanity, starting from the 21 st century and delving deeper into history. In this context, the author refers to other seminal pieces, which share a similar perspective on the matter at hand. In other words, history is not a perfectly ordered sequence of logical events. On the contrary, these occurrences are usually chaotic, but humanity attributes a perceived meaning to them in retrospect. Atlas (2012) discusses the contemporary projects that serve to reduce nature뗩 impact on people뗩 lives, such as MOSE flood gates in Italy. Such initiatives emphasize humanity뗩 views of natural phenomena as a nuisance rather than a force to be reckoned with.\\n\\nThe discussion presented within the article revolves around a central philosophical topic. This idea represents the ephemerality of human civilization, which is observed across the history of the world. As Atlas (2012) contemplates the existing monuments of the 20 th -21 st centuries, he writes about the great nations of the past, such as the Roman Empire, that never thought it would collapse in the way it did. Archaeological research shows the risks of such underestimations as experts investigate the failed societies of the past. For example, the Mayan nation was incredibly advanced for its period, building complex structures and fascinating monuments. However, as discussed by Diamond (2005), the lack of attention to natural resources and phenomena put an end to the great civilization. A similar scenario was discovered during the excavations on Easter Island. The Rapa Nui people managed to thrive in isolation in their remote part of the ocean, constructing monuments of unbelievable complexity. However, the internal discord within their enclosed community led to irrational use of limited resources combined with a ruthless feud. As a result, the once advanced civilization virtually ceased to exist.\\n\\nAt any major stage of global development, the Earth saw thriving centers of growth, most of which disappeared for certain reasons. In many cases, the lack of due attention to the influence of nature became the root of these problems. Furthermore, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, and eruptions continue to threaten the civilization of the 21 st century. Even though humanity little or no control over these phenomena, it can still increase the chances of its survival by approaching the matter with due respect. In addition, complex societies face threats from socioeconomic issues, as well. Archaeology provides modern decision-makers with invaluable lessons of history. Taking them into account within the current landscape will positively affect the development of modern civilizations, allowing humanity to avoid the mistakes of the past.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nAtlas, J.

Before arriving at my designated place for eating, my feet carried me past the most romantic, unique, enticing display of ooh la la's I have ever seen for such a quaint little boutique: Agent Provacateur. Oh how adorable those quirky mannequins looked in frilly, salacious, provocative displays of pink and black silken lacealong with a background wallpaper of the shop's own star graphic novel character, all decked out (at least for the time being;D) in her signature undercover brown trench coatthe Agent herself. Oh how my secret love and desire for all things romantic, unique and classic ached my heart so much to want me to go enter that forbidden threshold, as if I were a child who has her nose pressed up on the glass, to the window that reveals the world of hidden candy goodiesin this case, eye candy goodies. Oh how I long to be clothed and adorned in such frivolity! My secret desire, no one newuntil now. To be an aspiring, glamorous retro pin-up model; to be like those classic, timeless women of the 1940's and 1950'sMarylin Monroe, Bettie Pagewith such a carefree yet confident and flirty, coy attitude; a come hither, girl-next-door personalitya secret naughty mixed with suspicious nicethat will blind the eyes and melt the heart of any man and ignite the fantasies that dance in their mindsall from the power of a single, simple, yet artistic pin-up photograph. Oh yes, how I long for that romantic dream to be a reality! But alas! I can only remain as a Romantic with no hope. All I can do now is be like those children who press their nose against that window glass and peer into the world of secret, untouchable goodiesknowing that their dear parents will never grant them the permission to indulge their senses in that sweet ecstasy. And so it has been done, my state of trance has been extinguished by the outrageous cost listed on the sales tag price (200 for a set)! Oh yes, I have strolled through the boutique and looked at the goodies through cyberspace , and have seen the frivolous price tag for all the goods (still super expensive unless you sign up for their newsletter; you can get in on their secret, 50-75 off sales if you do so)! So it seems now that my hopeful reality must further be delayed; further be suspended in that intoxicating, tantalizing trance. Until then....until then....one day, I will be blessed by the fairy godmother of financial goodies, and at last I shall be that frivolous, voluptuous, vivacious pin-up bombshell that I so longed to be! Someday....you and I shall be sinister partners-in-crime, Agent Provocateur. Did you know that Agent Provocateur was founded by Joseph Corre, son of the most influential fashion designer of the entire fashion world, Vivienne Westwood? Vivienne Westwood is the founding mother of punk fashion. Corre is also the son of the Sex Pistol's ex -manager, Malcolm McLaren. SEX PISTOLS! VIVIENNE WESTWOOD! How much more punk can you get?

       " Document(page_content=\"I am for the development of driver-less cars. Television and movies have long been fascinated with cars that could drive themselves. Google has made cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. Having driver-less cars in the near future would make it a lot easier on adult drivers. The drivers would still have to be alert, but the cars would alert them at any time there is danger or at any time the drivers need to be extra careful. I agree with the development of having driver-less cars.\\n\\nThe new driver-less cars have sensors. Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor. Automakers use speed sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes. The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.\\n\\nThe driver-less car still needs a driver no matter what technology they bring into the automotive systems. Dr. Werener Huber says that they have to interpret the driving fun in a new way. Some manufacturers suggested that they do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. The display could be turned off when the driver needs to take over. In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature and safety is a big concern when it comes to driving.\\n\\nMost driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe. Lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers. Traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. Driver-less cars wouldn't be breaking the laws by driving them around becuase driver-less cars have to have a human driver in the car at all times incase something were to go wrong. The human driver would be able to fix the problem.\\n\\nAutomakers are continuing their work on solving all the problems that will need to be solved ahead of time before human drivers can start driving these cars. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020. The road to the truly autonomous car stretches on ahead of us all, but we are growing closer to the destination every day. I personally agree with the making of driver-less cars.      \"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Hello everyone. Hopefully you can help me with a bit of a moral dilemma I\\'m having. The Irish government is currently implementing water charges for all citizens that use public water systems. The deadline for registration with the company tasked with collecting these charges, Irish Water, passed on Monday. [There has been nationwide opposition to this and as it stands approximately half of \"customers\" have registered to pay (this figure is widely debated).] Even though I am in favour of metered charges for water I still have not made up my mind (although as my title suggests I\\'m leaning towards not registering). My reasons are: [The exorbitant cost of setting up the company (1.9b or more as I can\\'t find more up to date figures).] . Ireland is still in austerity, and ridiculous government overspending on bureaucratic quangos has been a successive theme in Irish politics for decades. [The involvement of billionaire Denis O\\' Brien, who earned the rights to Irelands second mobile phone (cell-phone) network by bribing a government minister] . His company Siteserv won the right to install water meters. I fear that he may purchase Irish Water if it ever becomes privatised (although this unlikely to occur in the next 10 years, Irish Water will take years to become reach the required profitability for privatisation) Irish Water and the governments complete and utter failure to communicate effectively with the Irish public, particularly with regards to charges for users. They have since rowed back on the initial high charges but the mistrust remains. The charges are a regressive tax burden that weighs most heavily on the poorest members of Irish society still struggling from years of austerity. I am not one of those unfortunate people thankfully. The government has had every opportunity to implement a transparent, fair and reasonable system to charge for water and has failed to do so at every opportunity. I think it speaks volumes about the scenario that even though I am in favour of water charges in principle, I am so alienated and disillusioned with the farce of our government and Irish Water that as it stands I will not be registering.

How did you manage the situation?(*) (200-250 words) An internal flame started to burn when I first read about polyphonic sleep. By sleeping several times a day, you can reduce your daily sleep to four hours. This idea contradicts common sense and mainstream science, and sounds plain crazy. This impossibility was the source of my motivation. My first two attempts were distressing failures. Naively, I believed that willpower would suffice for the hard adaptation period. However, I had often trouble to fall asleep or to get out of bed, resulting in sleep deprivation and self-reproaches. Both times\\' flu ended the experiment miserably. Because it is common to fail several times, I could accept failing once, but after the second failure I was very upset with myself. Realizing that preparation was necessary, I decided to try one last time. The following two weeks were like an uninterrupted fight with both Kitsch brothers, you really want to fall down but, if you do, you will not stand up again. I won this fight by increasing my self-discipline through watching inspirational videos, using \"Lose yourself\" as my alarm and taking cold showers only. I downloaded sleep-meditations, started sleeping on the floor and adopted a get-up-routine. After a month polyphonic sleep was as natural to me as breathing. Afterwards I learned speed-reading and experimented with lucid dreaming, which is the ability to control your dreams while you sleep. These experiences allowed me to get a glimpse of the amazingly endless human potential, and they filled me with passion to explore the human mind.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='I believe that using the FACS(Facial Action Coding System) is important to have/use in classroom to read students facial expression and to know what they are feeling, because some teacher\\'s may be going through the classwork or the lesson for the day too fast and a student may not understand what is going on and they are too scared or nervous to ask the teacher to slow down and/or repeat what they said so having the facial coding system will help teacher\\'s with that so they either know who to help or realize that they are going too fast and need to slow down or explain it better for other students to catch on. In the reading in paragraph six, it says \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored in class\" the facial coding would be good at helping teacher know what they need to do more in the class, like if a student is bored then the teacher would know that they need to do more fun activities in class that have something to do with the lesson for that day can help with people who are both confused and/or bored, it will help the students that are bored have something to do so they will not be bored and it would help the students that are confused get the hang of what is going on in the class and help them understand. In paragraph six it also says \"Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor\", meaning that facial coding would help teachers be able to know for sure if a student is confused or bored in a classroom. The facial coding system would not only help teachers figure out if a student is understanding classwork but it would also help to find out if a student is having personal issues and won\\'t say anything or they are too scared to say what\\'s going on, it would be more than helpful to know what that student is feeling and asking them about it and asking if they wanted to talk about and/or letting them know that they can talk to you if needed instead of knowing what that person is feeling and letting them keep their emotions bottled up and them not talking to anyone about how they feel and that student ends up doing something that could do harm to them or others. With that being said I believe that having the facial coding system would not only be helpful in classrooms but in schools too.'),\n",

It's not necessarily true that you have to have a transition word (however, therefore, etc.) after every sentence. You should try to construct your language with a more organic flow, creating a structure that would work with your content. What I mean when I say that transitions should be organic is that you should ask yourself if these are terms that you would naturally say if you are speaking these sentences out loud. Determining this is crucial in building your essay.  \\n  \\nIn addition, evade using unnecessary words when you are writing. Doing this will help you trim down and create a more concise and clear-cut structure.  \\n  \\n**Let's revise a couple of parts:**  \\n  \\n[...]  \\nAs the world is rapidly changing, jobs begin to require higher skills and knowledge.

Theoretical framework and scope\\n 5. Material\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThe evaluation of different cases in the sphere of law turns out to be an effective tool in accordance to which people뗩 awareness of jurisdictional law or various conflicts of laws is improved considerably. The example of the case where the conflict between Stolzenberg and Canada Trust Company is discussed helps to define the essence of multi-jurisdictional affairs that was connected to the collapse of a famous investment company, Castor Holdings, at the beginning of the 1990s. With the help of the case offered, it becomes possible to explain numerous legal problems like conflict of laws and its connection to the English judgment, the impact of Common Law rules and the existed European regime that is available for jurisdiction, the ways according to which a judgment may be analyzed, and the effectiveness of the regime of unification that is currently inherent to conflict of laws.\\n\\nPurposes\\n\\nThe major purpose of the project is to identify the peculiarities of the case and make use of the ideas offered in order to comprehend the trends in conflict of laws rules. To achieve good results with such kind of research, it is necessary to rely on both primary and secondary sources. First, it is better to get familiarized with the conditions of the case when Mr. Stolzenberg was accused of constant frauds which aim at investing of more than $240 million. Second, it is obligatory to rely on web sources by means of which it is possible to discover what different professionals think about the chosen case and how they can apply this information in law and life. Finally, it is important to identify the steps and realize that they have to be taken accordingly.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nMy research will be based on the case that happened in 1992 and analyzed by different people from different perspectives. In this case, Mr. Stolzenberg and the plaintiffs, Chrysler Canada Ltd addressed the court of law in order to define the scopes of the frauds done by the representatives the Castor Group and the punishment that has to be used. This situation demonstrates how public policy provisions of Brussels I may be evaded to a particular case law. The rules of Common Law and the European regime for jurisdiction need to be taken into consideration as well because English courts are characterized by a number of foreign elements and different connecting factors.\\n\\nTheoretical framework and scope\\n\\nOne of the most effective ways that have to be chosen for this project is the interpretive perspective that usually aims at interpreting meanings, negotiations, background facts, and legal provision. The meaning of the English judgment of the case under consideration will be given, the evaluation of the conditions under which English courts may develop, and the interpretation of legal elements. The evaluation of primary and secondary sources will introduce a proper picture of the case as well as the lessons which are possible to get.\\n\\nMaterial\\n\\nFirst, the case itself has to be used as the main source. Second, a number of theoretical literature will help to define the essence of a conflict of law. And finally, different opinions and ideas need to be used to realize what other people think of this case and the nature of the English judgment that is usually characterized by a number of foreign elements and different connecting factors. In general, the idea to develop a project around the case sounds rather persuasive and captivating to be recognized among the others.\\n'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='EDIT: [Here is a PDF] (URL0) of a paper written by Professor David Nutt on the relative dangers of different common drugs. The problem is that all substances are harmful to humans, in a high enough quantity that is. Even water, if you drink enough will poison you, its called Water intoxication and its not as uncommon as you might think. Everything, including drugs, must be put on a scale of harmfulness. This problem is also confounded by the fact that street drugs are often mixed with other unknown things and that the method of ingestion can be harmful. Cocaine is used as an aesthetic for eyes (yes, optometrists today squirt it in peoples eyes), but enough use will burn a hole right through your nose. Heroin kills by relaxing the user enough that their breathing slows down and they fall asleep, their breathing slows even more to the point that they cant regain consciousness, then they suffocate. Regular heroin use, so long as it is below a fatal dose, is relatively safe drug when it comes to long term health implications (ingestion method, adulterants and interaction with other drugs aside). If you give a list of drugs I can better break down their relative safenessharm. There are too many to go over. If the majority of your knowledge came from school, the media and government then it is probably mostly wrong.\\', \"There isn\\'t a list of substances you can put in your body consequence free. It probably won\\'t hurt you to examine different perspectives on the issue in trying to arrive at an informed decision about what you should put in your body.,There\\'s an old line: The dose makes the poison. Any drug can be harmful, but so can just about anything. As to \"harmful\" that can be subjective because different drugs affect people in different ways. Nicotine, separate from all the chemicals added to cigarettes is rather harmless. Alcohol taken in moderation (glass of wine at dinner a beer during a game) is rather harmless to most people. Now there\\'s two common ways people talk about harm, risk of Dependence and risk of physical damage. In both cases heroin is the most dangerous, by far. But other than heroin, the big \"danger\" drugs are meth, morphine (or similar pain killers), cocaine and barbiturates. Alcohol and tobacco are somewhere in the middle with marijuana and caffeine right behind that. The least dangerous tends to be hallucinogens, mostly because you need so little to have an effect.

       " Document(page_content='The short answer to this is that the laws are badly written. Although there are some smart legislators, the laws for most cybercrime developed at a time when the internet was very different, and with a focus on extreme cases. Since Congress wasn\\'t that familiar with the internet, laws tended to be written very generally, and old laws that might have needed updating, were left as they were. And since cybercrime seemed like a police nightmarewith mastermind hackers outwitting the police at every turnthe idea was that penalties needed to be severe. The idea was that this would be a bigger deterrent (like a 1,000 dollar fine instead of a 10 dollar fine) and make it easier for law enforcement to \"turn\" the hackers they did catch. The threat of decades in jail can work wonders when it comes to getting someone to rat on their friends. And so, today, you end up with situations like Swartz, and many others, where there are dozens of crimes that might be committed dozens of times each in any one incident, and where the prosecutor is free to charge all of them. And this combines with a general problem in the federal criminal justice system, which is that the actual \"punishment\" for any particular crime doesn\\'t necessarily control. The Federal [sentencing guidelines] (URL0) basically tell judges to combine crimes according to a formula when sentencing. So though Swartz could have gone to jail for decades, odds are it would have been a much shorter sentence. But, the defendant can\\'t be certain of that, and so it\\'s just another way to end up with unequal sentencing.\\', \"You\\'ll have to give another example here. Swartz was never actually sentenced - when you hear about his 50 years of imprisonment that is the maximum sentence, cumulative of each of the 13 felony counts he was charged and indicted for. Some of these related to physically breaking into secure locations. Things got to the point in negotiations where prosecution offered a 6 month plea deal, but this was rejected by Swartz\\'s defense attorney. We don\\'t even know if the system would have found him guilty, on which counts, and if guilty...how long he\\'d have been sentenced for.,\" \"Unfortunately, in cases like Swartz\\' and other younger\\'criminals\\', the powers that be seem to feel the need to set an example.

People will pay attention to the things that are inside the car and not the things outside the car like other cars around them or even other object around them.

The first batch of cars will have issues just like the first batch of everything that is new. The car could glitch up at any moment when the car is in motion and some one is in it. What are people gonna do when they are driving and the car just stops driving itself and runs off the road into oncoming traffic or runs off a mountain. What are the people gonna do when their family memebrs die because of the cars glitching up and killing their brother,sister, or cousin. The first thing they are going to do is blame the company and sue them for everything they have.\\n\\nThat is why I think \"driverless\" cars are stupid and dangerous. People will not pay attention they will car more about their phone. People will not pay attention to their surrounding they will pay attention to things inside the car.

Analysis: Milton Nkosi, BBC News President Jacob Zuma\\'s delayed willingness to pay back the money spent on the upgrades to his Nkandla residence could be a calculated move to avoid embarrassment at the Constitutional Court hearing expected next week.

The Nkandla scandal has been a sore point for the governing African National Congress (ANC) which President Zuma leads, especially as the party faithful go out to campaign for votes. Political analyst Professor Somadoda Fikeni told me that it could also be related to the president being \"politically vulnerable as he enters his\\'lame-duck\\' period and following his mis-appointment of finance ministers\" at the end of last year.

       " Document(page_content=\"I would like some feedback, thanks! In this world, amazing people were shaped by the dreams they had, Dreams and aspirations are developed over time starting very early in ones' life. There are many factors, such as one's family, school and community that shape what those dreams and aspirations are. For me, my family's influence was greater than the others. When I was entering eighth grade, my parents began feeding me ideas of becoming a successful doctor and making a good living. They began preparing me to be a doctor early in my schooling. It was piano lessons on the weekends, extra hours of memorizing multiplication tables in the summer, limited minutes with the television and hours with the science encyclopedia. It seemed they had been shaping me my whole life to be a doctor. As I gained wisdom and self consciousness, it occurred to me that my future was not to be a doctor and I thought that my parents were keeping me from reaching my aspirations. At the same time, I was inclined to satisfy my parents as they had been hyping of what I could become and out of respect for them, I hid the fact that I wanted to go as my heart pleased. The only outlet for my heart's desires was found in playing video games with my brothers and friends, as I could make my own choices and live with the consequences knowing that I made the choices that led to them. What first started as an escape became a mystery. I wondered how these games were made. I found that what seemed simple on the surface was created by a complex computer language that professionals were paid to create. This was when I decided that I would like to pursue something in the computer science field, but it was in the complete opposite direction of being a doctor. This disagreement between my Americanized Western philosophies of following my dreams in life did not mesh well with my parent's Chinese philosophy. The young would listen to what their parents told them and do as they said. The feeling of having to please my parents would last until my sophomore year at Rose mead High School. That year, my older brother was heading off to college and encouraged me to think about what I would do with my life. I decided to talk to my parents about my plans for the future. After dinner there would be a time to discuss our days with the family, a perfect time to expose my ideas to my parents. The air felt tense as I explained in broken Chinese that I was discovering an interest in computer science, from what I saw, they seemed puzzled. For the longest minute of my life I waited for my parent's response. They began to speak and explained that they had read about careers having to do with computers on the internet. At that moment I was amazed that my parents had used technology to connect and be open to the ideas of Western philosophies of chasing dreams and ambitions. This made me appreciate the brilliance of the computer science majors that had provided the technology that my parents used to broaden their scope of information and the escape they provided me through video games. I now aspire to be able to provide a way of connecting the world through technology, and connecting someone from a foreign country to another. I feel I can achieve this goal by going into the field of computer science and creating programs that both domestic and international people will use to share their commonalities. My parents were able to comprehend my situation, and I realized the mindset that they had. They have disciplined me to have dedication, effort, and consistency everything I attempt with the intention of doing the best I can, never to settle for anything less.\"),\n",

The article the Indefensible Electoral college: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong states \"Under the electoral college system, voters vote for not the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\" What\\'s the point of voting if our vote basically doesn\\'t matter because we are not the one choosing who is president. The same article also states \"Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always\" We the voters basically don\\'t even decide who\\'s president, the electors do, and we don\\'t even get to pick who the electors are, the state legislatures do. Why is the president based off of who the electors want? there\\'s only 538 of them, it should be based off popularity, the vote of the millions of the people who have voted. Honestly i see no point in voting now since our votes don\\'t decide who the president will be.\\n\\nElectoral college is unfair to the small states. The article five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president\\' shows a map of America with the number of electoral votes given to each state. If you look at the map, you\\'ll notice that the bigger states have more electoral votes, and the small states have very few. For example California has 55 electoral votes, Texas has 38, and Florida has 29. But states such as Alaska, Hawaii, and Maine have less than 5 electoral votes. Which basically means that their electoral votes don\\'t count nearly as much as the big states do.

       " Document(page_content='Moral Status of Animals at Factory Farming Essay\\n\\nEthics of factory farming\\n\\nStewart is concerned about the extent to which human beings are willing to mechanize animal farming to meet their needs. Human beings have a less ethical concern for animal lives and would sacrifice animal life and living condition to satisfy consumer demands.\\n\\nHowever, there exists an economic and ethical conflict of whether to produce more food through the use of the cruel animal farming method or to apply alternative methods that would support ethical animal farming practices. Stewart realizes that these farming methods that guarantee the animals rights and reduce their suffering would seriously affect many families that depend on such animal farming practices. Besides, animals and in particular, livestock are considered property. Property ownership rights give the owners the right to manage their property by the standard practices.\\n\\nStewart has a limited choice that he may apply to reduce the suffering that the animals undergo since there are no options for the more humane slaughter of animals. Whichever method is applied to slaughter the animals they still suffer pain and anxiety during the process. Besides, 랐egan activism would not have any significant influence on factory farming (Sapontzis, 1987). Whichever way, human beings would have to meet their demands through the use of such cruel methods.\\n\\nMoral Status of Animals\\n\\nAs human beings, we are faced with moral dilemmas of whether to compromise an animal뗩 health and environment to adequately satisfy our demands or to balance the environmental and health requirements of the animals. The calves lives are separated from that of their mothers and instead of feeding on their mothers milk, there are provided with food that contains chemicals to enable them mature faster. This does not provide the right environment for the animals growth. Animals require independent biotic communities where they are free to move and free to interact. Thus separating the calf from the mother is not morally right.\\n\\nThey also need to live in a society just like human beings. Animals also need to feed on natural food just like human beings. Providing chemicals in food to make them mature first for human beings consumption deprives the animals of important nutrients and vitamins, which are only found on natural vegetation and food. For example, separating the calf from the mother denies the calf the opportunity to obtain iron from the mother뗩 milk. It may lead to the calf suffering from anemia hence condemning the calf to sickness throughout their lives.\\n\\nReference List\\n\\nSapontzis, S. E. (1987). Morals, reasons and animals.

       " Document(page_content='The Concept of the US Two Presidencies Essay\\n\\nThe concept of the US being ruled by two centers of power was introduced by Wildavsky in 1966 (Fleisher, Bond, Krutz, and Hanna 4; Wildavsky 23). The author argued that one presidency was involved in ensuring domestic affairs of the country were maintained as intended.\\n\\nThe other presidency focused on ensuring that the US was maintaining good relations with other nations and the nation reacted in response to external aggression (Wildavsky 23).\\n\\nI find merit to the idea that the US should adopt a system that is characterized by two executives. One of the executives should focus on domestic policy while the other one should concentrate on foreign policy.\\n\\nThe importance of foreign policy cannot be overstated. The aspect is essential because the US exists within the context of the international community. For example, the country needs to maintain its good relations with the existing trade partners as well as with the aspiring trade partners.\\n\\nAlso, the superpower has to protect its citizens from any form of external aggression that could destabilise the economy of the country. The statements about the need to focus on foreign policy do not underestimate the pivotal impact of domestic policy.\\n\\nOne presidency has to ensure that the internal affairs of the country are running so that it can be on track with regard to economic growth.\\n\\nThe evidence for the need of two presidencies could be traced to the World War II, when it was demonstrated that the presidency had more powers to execute duties with regard to foreign policy than those related to domestic policy.\\n\\nThe role of the presidency during the time of World War II was so essential in protecting the interests of Americans both locally and internationally.\\n\\nCurrently, the president has the power to act in response to terrorist attacks that affect its citizens or other countries across the world. In fact, the presidency can order at any time for the deployment of the US military to the affected areas.\\n\\nIn the recent past, the presidency ordered for the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan, which were regarded as the centers of terrorism across the world. The illustrations reflect the importance of having a presidency with the power to commit resources to foreign missions.\\n\\nSuch powers are vested in the presidency. For example, the power of a Commander 늘n-Chief gives the president the authority to command the military to invade foreign countries (Wildavsky 28).\\n\\nThe presidency reacted in a swift manner during the attack on South Korea and accumulation of powerful missiles in Cuba. In fact, even the general public expects that the presidency has to act in response to external insecurity issues.\\n\\nIn order to act on domestic matters, the presidency has to win the support of the Congress (Fleisher et al 5; Wildavsky 30).\\n\\nFor example, the presidency could have a bright idea of improving accessibility of healthcare by the US citizens, but such a move cannot be passed without the support of a majority number in the Congress.\\n\\nThus, the presidency has limited powers to commit resources toward domestic affairs unlike those intended for foreign policy.\\n\\nIn conclusion, there is a need to adopt a governing system that has two presidencies that could have independent powers. One presidency would focus improving domestic policy while the other one would concentrate on ensuring that the US has an excellent platform of foreign policy.\\n\\nThis could be essential in the context of an increasing demand for protection against terrorists and the need to improve domestic policy of the country.\\n\\nWorks Cited:\\n\\nFleisher, Richard, Jon R.

       " Document(page_content='Journalism and Controversial Topics Essay\\n\\nIn the modern world, there are many phenomena that can cause a vivid and ambiguous reaction from the public. As a rule, they are related to religion, racial and class inequality, or relationships between people of different genders and ages. In particular, harassment by priests towards little boys is an important topic. The purpose of this paper is to reveal the need to discuss this and similar topics in various types of media.\\n\\nFirst, it is necessary to understand whether journalists should spend money and efforts on this type of content. On the one hand, the public always actrively discusses texts and films of such content. People are not ready to calmly accept such events, therefore, such information may become too difficult for perception. Some feel that the topics of violence cannot be hushed up, so they distribute such content. Others turn a blind eye to them and only criticize films and articles on this topic. This complicates the dissemination of information and does not give people an unambiguous understanding of the issue.\\n\\nOn the other hand, despite the reaction of the public, as many people as possible should learn about questions of this nature. This will draw public attention to problems that have existed for decades. Consequently, the authorities will be more attentive to them too. They have more opportunities to solve such global problems than the general population. Thus, the more actively people disclose and discuss information about violence, the more likely it will be eradicated.\\n\\nThus, in my opinion, it is necessary to spend money on films and articles about violence in churches. This type of journalism can help protect children and make the church system truly effective and righteous (Globe Spotlight Team, 2002). People will trust the clergy more and will not be afraid for their children. This will contribute to an increase in the level of well-being of society in general and the improvement of the church system in particular.\\n\\nResearch by journalists and politicians can truly make many aspects of people뗩 lives more correct and legitimate. For example, a recent study of six major universities, including Cornell and MIT, found illegal fundraising. They have already discovered $6.5 million that came from Qatar, China, Saudi Arabia, and other countries (Offord, 2020). The investigation continues at Harvard, Yale, and other educational institutions.\\n\\nInvestigations like this show that in many areas of life, people try to get the maximum benefit. This desire is understandable, but it should not happen to the detriment of anyone. Therefore, cases of illegal actions must be disclosed and reported in the media. This will help society better understand what is happening in the world and be confident in its safety. As a result, people will be protected, and anyone who commits unequal actions will be punished. Society will become more just and people will become more calm and open.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nGlobe Spotlight Team (2002).

       " Document(page_content=\"I have a bag that I have used for almost four years. My parents gave it to me as a present for becoming a legitimate freshman in Trinidad and Tobago. I was happy because my old Nike bag was torn apart by the sharp corners of textbooks that continuously rubbed against the bag. I still remember the first day I packed my new bag with school materials. The new yet stiff bag seemed to hold extra textbooks and two more notebooks that I used to carry with my hands. I was so happy. To me, having more books in the bag meant heavier load, but it gave me an impression that I finally became old enough to pursue a higher degree in academics. With the high expectations of high school and the new challenge I would face, I enthusiastically walked to school wearing this bag. But time passed. I moved to Libya, stayed there for a year, and evacuated to Turkey. I had to live with my mother since my dad had to stay in Libya. Because of my dad's absence, my mother and I had trouble adapting to the new environment. Also, my new school's classes were much more challenging compared to the one in Libya. It had more course work and competition. So with the increased competition and all the trouble (adapting), I started to get frustrated with school. So one day, when I came home after school, I threw my bag on my bed, sat down on my seat, and opened my laptop to play games. However, I felt uncomfortable. I did not know why. In an attempt to find the cause, I looked around, and my eyes stopped at the bag. I suddenly remembered my first day with the bag in Trinidad: walking to school eagerly and enthusiastically, yearning to learn new ideas and concepts. Since that day, I have grown both physically and mentally, but my attitude towards learning did not. To me, the bag symbolized my passion for academics. Throwing my bag meant that I mistreated and abandoned academics. I felt horrible. That is when I thought I should return to my old self and start fresh with the feelings and expectations towards learning. Since then, I have taken my bag everywhere to remind myself. Eventually, I overcame my stress and started to focus on studying. I thank my bag all the time. Without it, I would not be where I am right now. I hope it guides me in college.\"),\n",

Conclusion\\n 5. References\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThe technology is often viewed as an incredible benefit to mankind. The invention of cell phones have greatly increased our ability to communicate. It conserves our time and money making business and personal affairs organized more easily. However, people often forget about the price we have to pay for that kind of benefit. Some researchers state that there are negative influences of mobile phones on human body in the psychological and physiological fields (Pall, 2013).\\n\\nPsychological Effects\\n\\nThe psychological effects of the cell phone usage are similar to narcotic addiction (Augner & Hacker, 2012). Among the most common symptoms are aggression, unwillingness to perform everyday choirs due to engagement in games or chats, disconnectedness from piers, forgetfulness and other (Strasburger et al., 2013). It can be argued that such adverse effects stem from the inability of a person to cope with the information flow that started to surround the 21st-century person. However, it is, in part, the mobile phones that facilitated such flow giving every person the ability to access it by a pair of simple gestures.\\n\\nPhysiological Effects\\n\\nIt has been proven by experimental research that electromagnetic radiation that cellphones emit is sufficient to negatively affect the activeness of key enzymes in testicles thereby hindering the reproductive function. In addition, the studies show that active cell phone users are more likely to develop cancer (Corle, Makale, & Kesari, 2012). There is still argument about the interpretation of the data and connectedness of cell phones to the facts of physiological problems, but the harmful effect of long exposure to the electromagnetic radiation appears to be a fact (Akbal, Kiran, Sahin, Turgut-Balik, & Balik, 2012; Al-Damegh, 2012).\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nAll things considered, some researchers are certain that there is negative influence coming from cell phones. Increased caution must be exercised in handling them. Especially it concerns cases of overuse as it poses the greatest dangers to both mind and body.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nAkbal, A., Kiran, Y., Sahin, A., Turgut-Balik, D., & Balik, H. H. (2012).

After a brief pause, he replied, \"Your race built the most advanced technologies the Universe had ever seen, and we want to replicate it.\" BINGO! There it is. Another one of the races that wants human technology. This was a problem even when the human race was around, sentient beings from around the Universe would come knocking, asking for advanced tech, weapons, or help them fight their war against some other nameless species.

Those machines we built were used for war, an entire galaxy was destroyed in an instant, and we realized the blood trail that we had left behind. Did you know that the bloodthirst of an entire race could be filled? Well, ours was, and realizing what we have done, we decided to leave the Universe, let another, perhaps less violent race, to appreciate the beauty of the world. Remember those blackholes you had to pass through to get to Earth? The mazes of temporal and spacial wormholes that no doubt confused you? We put those there. We wanted to be left along, and slowly fade away from the world. For what is the purpose of a race, if we spent all our effort fighting one war after another, until the point that we lost all other purpose in life but violence? And then we lost the single purpose that we still had? No, Bar\\'lon. I do not want to help you fight your war. I do not want to help you raise the human race again.

However, it is not found in humans\\' closest living relatives, the chimpanzees. As early humans evolved, they developed larger and more complex brains, which can process and store a lot of information. Last year, scientists pinpointed a human gene that they think was behind the expansion of a key brain region known as the neocortex. They believe the gene arose about five or six million years ago, after the human line had split off from chimpanzees. Now, researchers have found a tiny DNA change - a point mutation - that appears to have changed the function of the gene, sparking the process of expansion of the neocortex.

Dr Wieland Huttner of the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics in Dresden, Germany, led the research. \"A point mutation in a human-specific gene gave it a function that allows expansion of the relevant stem cells that make a brain big,\" he told BBC News. \"This one, as it is fixed in the human genome - so all living humans have the gene - apparently gave a tremendous selection advantage, and that\\'s why we believe it spread in the human population.\" Between two and six million years ago, the ancestors of modern humans began to walk upright and use simple tools. During this extended period of time, their brain size started to increase. They began to spread around the world, encountering different environments. From about 800,000 years ago, their brain size increased further, helping them to survive in a changing world. Still, many questions remain about how early humans evolved larger brains. It is likely that the gene is one of many genetic changes that gave humans their unique intelligence and thinking ability. The research is published in the journal, Science Advances.

       " Document(page_content='Nursing Practice: The Role of Nursing Coursework\\n\\nI attended the 25th Anniversary Celebration of National Black nurses Day. It took place in L뗀nfant Plaza Hotel (480 L뗀nfant Plaza, SW Washington, DC 20034). Among sponsors of the event were such companies as Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, Bon Secours Neuroscience Institute, Coca Cola Company, and Pfizer Inc. The meeting was professional were professional nurses, researchers and students shared their ideas on a variety of issues. Such topics as malnutrition, adult nutrition research, development, childhood obesity were highlighted. Some PowerPoint presentations on these issues were conducted. Students of medical schools also presented results of their surveys on problems that existed in their schools. This was a very informative event as it provided several insights into the present state and possible areas to develop in the contemporary nursing practice.\\n\\nI believe such events are very important as nurses can share their experiences and concerns, which positively affects the development of the nursing practice. It is necessary to note that there is a lot of confusion in nursing practice. This confusion is because healthcare professionals do not have similar ideas on the roles played. Thus, nurses often fulfill the work of other professionals and sometimes this leads to overlap (White et al., 2008). Importantly there is almost no confusion in nursing practice as nurses tend to have similar views on their role and their responsibilities. White et al. (2008) state that nurses (who took part in their survey) pointed out three major spheres of nursing practice: physical assessment, social and cultural development, and mental state. Nurses check clients physical state (taking blood pressure, temperature, helping them take medicine, etc.). Nurses also work with clients relatives trying to comfort them and informing them about their close ones state. Of course, nurses also help clients cope with depression, anxiety, etc. However, when it comes to their workplace, confusion comes into play (White et al., 2008). Nurses often work 24/7. When other healthcare professionals leave, nurses often fulfill tasks that were completed earlier. This happens due to the lack of communication and cooperation among healthcare professionals in the workplace. This is one of the major issues to be addressed.\\n\\nIt is necessary to state that nurses play a very important role and nursing can hardly be overestimated. Nurses have supported patients and provided medical assistance to other healthcare professionals for decades and even centuries without many regulations or rules (Barton et al., 2012). Now nurses can be regarded as a link between clients and other healthcare professionals. Nurses carry out a variety of tasks that help provide high-quality care to clients. Apart from purely medical assistance, nurses often comfort patients, which is essential for their healing. Admittedly, due to the development of nursing education, novice nurses are qualified professionals who understand their tasks clearly and are ready to cope with a variety of issues. However, there is still a need in developing certain codes and strategies to help healthcare professionals cooperate effectively.\\n\\nReference List\\n\\nBarton, T.D., Bevan, L. & Mooney, G. (2012).

In my opinion, I believe that apart from economy, government should also consider other types of progress which also consider other types of progress which give equal importance to a nation.\\nfirst of all, it is widely believed that increase in gross domestic product is related to economic growth, which governments also think is their main aim to focus on. This in other terms lead to an good export and import trading. For example, an imported product is more expensive when compared with native product in terms of quality and manufacturing, where more money is invested by government. Therfore, governments main focus shouldn't be only on economy.\\nDesipte this, on the other hand,many argue that governments should also think about considering other types of progress which are as equal as economic progress. for instance, many countries are being recognized because of their education status and culture which attracts young stars to travel and study which in other terms also increase GDP. Other important factor is sports, by participating in worldcups, and olympics will also make a valuable progress by being recognized world-wide may lead to many opportunities. As a reason, the country's government should also focus more on other factors leading to progress.\\nIn conclusion, I believe that government should not solely goal for economic growth but also concentrate on other factors which are equally important for a country's growth.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='In the UK we have recently implemented Citizenship] \" classes for secondary school children. In rough terms the stated aim is to endow a child with basic knowledge about how the political, financial and legal systems of Britain work. The format of these classes often revolves around discussion of topics such as diversity, equality and so on. According to a few (left-wing) friends who work in education, the effect of these classes is often to promote values of the Left, and often end with religious kids being shouted down by their peers. I tend towards the classical liberal line myself, so most of these values being promoted are not entirely against my own political thinking. Yet I do find it troubling that what seems to be a very politicised subject has entered the classrooms apparently by the backdoor. Whilst there are certain values that schools probably should promote (obedience to the law, respect for individual rights), these classes seem to be fostering conformism rather than scepticism, which seems to me to be the wrong priorities for an educational establishment. Clearly such classes differ over the world, and some will be more heavily politicised (and in different directions) than others. Whilst I do think children should be educated about the nature of their country\\'s politics, laws and so on, it seems more should be done to guard against it becoming a propaganda tool for the Left (more likely given the general inclination of teachers) or the Right.

The UNRRA is an administration that helps a country that has lost quite a bit in the war. The UNRRA helped countries that lost food supply, animal supply, and more. They hired \"Seagoing Cowboys\" to help care for the horses, young cows, and mule that were going to be shiped to other countries.\\n\\nI think that there are many reasons that people should join the UNRRA. The first reason that I have provided for you is that This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. The second reason I have is because even though you will be working you will be able to spend time with animals and you will see many sites that you would not have seen if you would have stayed home. The third reason I will provide is that not many people can do big oversea trips like that, a lot of people get very seasick. My final reason is that you would know you would be helping innocent people. You would know this because not everybody is in on these wars in fact most people are not in on big wars because they know it will tear apart their family.\\n\\nI think that there are some claims that Luke has made that I should share. I think that one of Luke\\'s claims that I should share is he said, \"I\\'m grateful for the opportunity. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.\". I think that he could support this because a lot of people, families, homes, and countries are destroyed and seperated. Another of Luke\\'s claims was, \"Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Accropolis in Greece was special.\" I think that this can be supported because this would be truely amazing. I think that he did a good thing to choose to help the UNRRA, but being able to see Europe, China, and Greece would be incredible.\\n\\nI think that Luke was a very incredible \"Seagoing Cowboy\". I think that some details to suppot this are that he lasted 9 trips to nine different countries. This is incredible because that is the longest any \"Seagoing Cowboy\" has ever lasted. I think another reason he is an incredible \"Seagoing Cowboy\" is because he decided to help the UNRRA. I bet that at the begining he was extremely nervous and I bet that he wanted to go home to his mom, dad, and siblings if he had any. My last reason that he was incredible is that he kept working even if he got seasick, or if he wanted to go home. I think that work was one thing that he used to get his mind off of things he worried about.\\n\\nThere are some thing that he could\\'ve done on the positive and the negative side. First, on the positive side, I thinkthat if he really set his mind to it he could\\'ve been a \"Seagoing Cowboy\" for at least 10-12 trips. I think that some benefits to staying longer would be that you would\\'ve been able to do more sight seeing, also you would\\'ve been able to spend more time with the animals. One thing that would be negative is that he would\\'ve gotten seasick more times than without staying.\\n\\nI think that I would\\'ve signed up for this opportunity because I love animals and I really like being on the ocean. I think that this would be a great chance. I think that they should have things like this in 2016. I think that there are a lot of countries that could use something like this, one that I can think of off the top of my head is Syria. They could use all the help they could get, they could use food, shelter, animal products, and animals in general. I think that I would think the same way as Luke. I think that me and my friends would all sign up and we would do everything together. We would care for the animals together, we would eat together, we would sightsee together, and lastly we would take breaks and stop together. My overall thought is that this would be great but it would also be extremely dangerous.'),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Preface this as always: Answering an internet question is not a substitute for seeking medical care with a physical exam. A few things come to mind as to why you might have a delay in feeling pain after experiencing a trauma. 1. You may now be experiencing bursitis. A bursa is essential a fluid filled bag with fluid. It insulates a tendon going over a bony prominence. Think of a zip lock half filled with water, closed and laying on your kitchen counter. Now place your hand on the zip lock, move it around. No friction between your hand and the counter - it is absorbed by the bag. That\\'s what a bursa does. You can bang a bursa, which causes some swelling and that injury sets off a whole cycle of increased friction, increased swelling, etc, typically occurring with continued activity. 2. This may be the start of a skin infection, called cellulitis. This is usually sore, tender to even gentle touch. It often will have some red or pink region (but not always in the beginning) and usually will be warm or even hot to the touch. It is characteristic that this usually has a very distinct pain border. Painful here, an inch away, not painful. It will need antibiotics to get better. Therefore you need to go to the doctor for it. 3. This may be from a deep bruise. A bruise is just bleeding on the inside. Sometimes there is a deep bruise that you don\\'t even see for a few days. It will eventually surface or it sometimes is \"dependent\" which means it will start to migrate down your leg or arm - free blood pulled by gravity. Injury to the calf, bruise pools around your ankle. A large hematoma (aka bruise) can cause irritation and spark an inflammatory response - thereby making it painful. Usually this is going to be painful from the start, though may be painful somewhere else a few days later. 4. Sacral strain. The sacrum is a fused set of vertebra that is immediately below the lumbar part of the spine. It is an inverted triangular shaped bone with the tail bone at the bottom point. Straining the ligaments that hold it in place can precipitate swelling which in turn exerts pressure on the nerves that emanate from the sacrum, causing pain. Above are a few ideas. Mostly these are benign conditions, but the infection needs medical attention. Therefore if it starts worsening or you start feeling bad, like fever andor nausea with worsening pain, then seek care earlier rather than later.'),\n",

From laws, to printed documents of government and even electing our president. We should keep the Electoral college to vote for president. We should keep it the way it is for many reasons, this country was started that way, you vote in either democratic or republican party, and there are larger states then others with more people. There would be a whole lot of confusion if it was based on election by popular vote.\\n\\nThis country was built by the Founding Fathers with a purpose, to be free, have rights, but built with certian laws and ways that are done by government. This country was founded with the system of Electoral College when voting for president. The story states \"The Founding Fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.\" That statement means all the laws and ways of government that we have today for electing presidents was made by the founding fathers for a reason.\\n\\nMany people have certian beliefs and some aren\\'t found in Democratic or Republican party for certain people. Some Republicans may believe in a certian way that some Democrats do not, and even the other way around. Because of the Electoral College, we can vote for a specific party that we agree more with their beliefs. We go through the slate electors that we agree more with and then vote for President.\\n\\nPopular voting would be difficult in another way because, there are larger states that the majority of people may believe in one way then another state that is tiny that believe in a whole other way. With states like California and Texasthat are huge states compared to Rhode Island and New Jersey that are tiny, the popular votes wouldn\\'t be fair if the larger states believe in a differents way that the smaller states. It would be less difficult to just keep the Electoral College.\\n\\nAlthough both systems may have a confusing side, we were made as a country in certian ways of government. This country was started with the Electoral College. You vote through a slate with either Democratic or Republican party. Lastly, there are larger states then others so popular voting would be unfair. So I think we should keep Electoral College when voting for the President of the United States.    \\xa0    '),\n",

Later in that appointment, the girl\\'s mother asked me where I went to medical school, and complimented me for calming down her daughter. We both laughed when she realized that I was nowhere near medical school, but it made me excited knowing that this family valued the initiative I took in comforting the girl. I felt empowered by this feeling of helping others, but found myself wanting to also be able to treat their sickness, and so began looking at the career of being a physician scientist. With this in mind, I spent the summer of sophomore year working in an oncology lab at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and returned to the bench at Brigham and Women\\'s Hospital junior year to explore the more hypothetical side of biology and try to understand the work \\'behind the scenes\\'. It was an amazing experience being on the \"cutting edge\" of science, and I was intrigued to find that the lifelessness of collecting data from electrophoresis gels and analyzing the DNA of mice may someday be the basis of life changing vaccines for diseases. I couldn\\'t wrap my head around the fact that with successful research, entire populations can be treated. I also spent two weeks in the Changsha Hospital of Shanghai this summer studying the practical application of biology through medicine. After being in operating rooms with surgeons and watching them help patients stitch by stitch, I was overwhelmed by how fine the art of surgery is, and how truly delicate life can be. It was amazing to see how surely a surgeon could remove so much of a patient and still make them better in the end. As children, we understand that once you put a band-aid over a wound, it seems to mysteriously feel better instantly regardless of whether the pain has actually gone away. I have always been interested in understanding and alleviating the pain that others feel; in becoming a physician and healing the wound beneath the bandage. Everywhere I go, I see the strength in the belief that doctors are the people who will walk with you through better and worse and will believe in you when no one else will. For me, the journey I have taken so far in exploring the width and depth of the medical field is out of my hope to become that physician who will help and ask their patients to persevere, fight through, and never give up.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The Responsibility of Professional Nurses Coursework\\n\\nProfessional nurses are tasked with the responsibility of creating and sustaining a culture of safety within their areas of work. This is achieved by concentrating on placing several governing boards that talk of safety measures within areas where care is offered. Secondly, the idea of evidence-based management as well as effective nursing leadership is essential in fostering a culture of safety. To sustain the culture, professional nurses identify adequate staffing as a proper recipe towards perfect sustenance of a safety culture. Nurses also focus on the provision of unending erudition and clinical decision making support for the nursing personnel. Methods that advance interdisciplinary cooperation have also been considered to be very efficient too. Work design routines that guard against exhaustion and precarious work as well as a very fair system of error reporting analysis, feedback process and good rewards for overall patient safety are regarded highly in professional nursing towards improving culture of patient safety (Hughes, 2008).\\n\\nThe type of environment that a nurse operates in could determine the quality of care that is accorded to a patient. To promote a safe environment and avoid blames arising from errors, nurses have to ensure that their working conditions are up to standard and that they lack nothing. For instance, they should insist on adequate resource allocation as well as the institution of proper policies and standards so that there is shared responsibility and not a case where they have to take responsibility for every shortcoming coming their way (Hughes, 2008).\\n\\nThe path took by nurses towards fostering patient safety is very significant. It is likely to bring great changes in the nature of responsibility that nurses have to take on. In addition, the overall patient care improves in the long run as proper measures and tactics operate towards bettering service provision of health care by the nurses.\\n\\nReference\\n\\nHughes, R.

We were forced to leave the States in a matter of six months, and I had no choice but to withdraw from all the universities I had persistently and diligently pushed myself for years to be accepted into. However shocking and tragic this news was to me, I took it as an opportunity to return to my motherland which I had long forgotten its culture and language, and to my surprise, the journey has been simply amazing. The place I have truly experienced the meaning of accomplishment was here in Korea. I began with baby steps at square 1, re-learning the language, attempting to absorb and replicate the Korean ways of living, and rebuilding relationships of which I began with none. Today, I am a college student at one of the most prestigious universities in Korea, impeccably bilingual with immaculate pronunciation with ability to associate within two very contrasting social atmosphere. What began as a personal adversity became a scholastic challenge, and it is one that I have found after fighting through the waves that have come crashing at me. I intend to return to the United States and complete my undergraduate studies in Public Policy at XXXXXXXXX Business School after which I endeavor to attend Law School. Upon my completion of education, I aspire to return to my motherland, serving as a legal bridge between Korea and the States in this ever-growing globalized world, applying not only my education but also my ability to make a difference in the business world. It is the classic and redundant story of most of the 35.2 million immigrants living in America, but it is the most significant and defining story for me. Significant and Defining because it is that that has awakened me to realize the endless limit I have before me.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Write about the following topic:Some people think that hosting an international sports event is good for the country, while some people think it is bad. Discuss both views and state your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.People hold different views about the benefits of hosting an international sports. While there are little advantages for some countries throwing such a sports event, I am convinced that holding an international sports event benefits the hosting country.\\nOn the one hand, there are several reasons why in some situations people think it is bad for a country to host an international sports event. In the first place, average people draw more attention to daily necessities and medical treatments. They believe hosting such an event is of little value compared with basic infrastructure and amenities. Instead, they hold that if invested in economic development and recovery, the good effects will be doubled. Presumably, if a country , like Afghanistan and Iraq, host an international sports event regardless of its capacity, the country will lose its people's faith because after a war, people all want to fill their belly and want the famine to be eradicated.\\nOn the other hand, throwing an international sports event can be a great means of developing a country's economy. Hosting an international sports event spurrs the economy and provide large quantities of employment for people, which revives and thrives all various industries. Apart from that, a sports event held by a country advocates the theme of health and sports, encouraging people there to lead a green positive attitude towards life, as well as setting up its renowned international position. Therefore, after the event, excellent businessman and geniuses all around the world will be attracted to invest there.\\nIn conclusion, I can understand why people are unwilling to hold an international sports event, but it seems to me that more advantages of hosting one event like that outweigh than that of not conducting one.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='In retrospect, my interests were aimless in the beginning of high school. I had always dabbled in various activities as my ideas changed, but it was not until the end of the sophomore year when one particular concept began having an impact on me. In the summer of 2012, I worked in the Cornell Presbyterian Hospital due to my curiosity in medicine. I have always believed that people have to experience things firsthand to discover their passion. As a site navigator, I was allowed to travel around many parts of the hospital with patients and visitors. Despite the activities that went on around the building, it was surprising how calm everything seemed. I eventually became an \"ambassador\" and this is when I really became interested in how each department interacted with each other as an efficient and cohesive whole. I later learned that this had to do with organizational behavior and I became completely engrossed in how the concept dictated so many aspects of society. After taking Geopolitics in Junior year, the ideas of over-organization, globalization and the internet revolution made me realize how much influence organizing could have. Even though I found the concept challenging to fully comprehend, I realized that it permeated my life from my school, to my parents\\' restaurant, to the Model UN club I was a member of. For any of these groups to function, all the units in it had to work well with each other. I took further steps into this idea in the summer of junior year when I joined the Summer leadership institute (SLI) and worked in the New York Campaign for Public advocate. The campaign really helped solidify my interest in the world of public policies and politics. SLI fueled my pursuit in this topic because it showed me real world problems that these skills could be used to solve. It also taught me leadership skills that I used to lead a small group of students in an event called New York Beautification day. Issues such as the student to prison pipeline and the rising costs of education could be solved through political activism and nonprofit organizations, both of which require skills taught at the School of Industrial Labor and Relations. The ILL curriculum hits all the topics I want to learn in order to fulfill my desire to understand how things relationships and networks work in a large scale organization. I am confident that it will teach me the skills to be an effective leader that can undertake the various social problems that exist in society. The classes ILL focus on can help me learn more about educational systems, labor unions and other groups that are crucial to the structure of our lives. I choose Cornell ILL because it will help me become a person who can help mold and reinvent outdated policies and ideas into new ones that can have profoundly positive effects for the future of our society.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Dear Senator, I am writing you to explain why the Electoral College system of choosing the president should be changed. The president should be chosen based on popular vote instead of the current system. The Electoral College system is unfair to certain states and somewhat confusing to others. I am certain that my views on this issue are not the only ones.\\n\\nFirst off, the Electoral College system is unfair to states. Candidates for president don\\'t spend time in states that they know they have no chance of winning in. This is due to the Electoral College morphing the states into a winnertakesall system as said by the Office of the Federal register in \"What is the Electoral College?\". This means that the winning popular vote in each state wins the electoral vote for that state as well. The thing is, however the number of people voting compared to the number of electoral votes is unfair. I am aware that the number of electoral votes comes from the state\\'s population, but imagine this California, which has 55 electoral votes gets visited by this tobepresident and wins it over only by a small margin. Wyoming, which has 3 electoral votes, doesn\\'t get a visit by this candidate because he thinks that 55 votes is more important than three and a large majority of this state votes against him. The candidate then loses three electoral votes, but wins 55. Sounds like everything works out well right? Wrong. The other half of the voters in California combined with the majority of voters in Wyoming could have taken the vote if it weren\\'t for the Electoral College. With popular vote the candidates would have to actually care about the states like Wyoming instead of ignoring them with Electoral College. With the popular vote system everyone has a say.\\n\\nTo continue, the Electoral College should be replace because of the confusion it causes. Most people believe that when they vote they are voting for president. However, what they dont know is that they are actually voting for a slate of electors. This slate of electors then votes for who they want to be president, and this might not always be the choice you want. With the popular vote system there would be no confusion and no voting on people who you want to vote for you. Do we really know who we\\'re voting for? Or are we just going on luck? The reason why so many americans do not vote is because they think that even though they vote, they do not have a say on who\\'s gonna win. With the popular vote system we could directly vote on who we belive to be the right choice for president.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College system should be replaced because with a popular vote system there would be fairness to all states and no confusion on who you\\'re really voting on. With all of this said, I hope you consider my request and try to make a change.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Exploring Business: British Petroleum (BP) Essay\\n\\nThe significant oil leak disaster in the Gulf of Mexico is closely associated with the activities of the British Petroleum (BP) because the company could not prevent the disaster, and it could not overcome its negative consequences adequately because of the lack of the effective contingency and crisis management plans.\\n\\nTo provide the compensation to cope with disaster뗩 consequences and to overcome the issues associated with the consumers boycotts, BP implemented the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Trust and provided the necessary financial initiatives to support the ecological and environmental investigations connected with the disaster.\\n\\nHowever, these initiatives and attempts to compensate the problem cannot be discussed as enough to change the consumers attitude to BP because the company had the similar problems earlier, and the absence of the necessary plan to predict or overcome the challenge supports the idea that the further disasters can be possible.\\n\\nIt is important to note that BP failed to recognize such ethical questions as the negative experience of the previous disasters and safety violations because the industry experts drew the company뗩 attention to warnings on the company뗩 safety.\\n\\nFurthermore, the necessary conclusions were not made, the safety was not improved, and the effective crisis management plan was not developed. As a result, the company뗩 workers were killed, and the threatening situation for the environment was created because of BP뗩 rather negligent behaviour and ignorance of warnings.\\n\\nBeing one of the leaders within the industry, BP contributes to its further marketing success while using the company뗩 effective reputation. The success of such a company within the industry highly depends on the previous effectiveness and reputation because of the importance to attract consumers with references to the quality of the services and products provided.\\n\\nhe oil leak disaster resulted in worsening the company뗩 reputation significantly, and the fact led to boycotting the products because the previous reputation was questioned.\\n\\nThe organization뗩 reputation significantly depends on different ethical issues and the company뗩 abilities to overcome them. For instance, Kraft Foods Inc. failed to respond adequately to the ethical issues associated also with social problems during the 2000s. The company was discussed as producing and promoting unhealthy products for children.\\n\\nTo save profits and to meet the company뗩 needs, Kraft Foods Inc. chose change the advertising policies and approaches rather than to respond to the social and legal claims (Ferrell, Fraedrich, & Ferrell, 2011, p. 84). Thus, the ethical behaviour was violated as well as the response to the customers interests.\\n\\nThe other company, T-Mobile USA, identified the risks of the unethical behaviour in time and provided the possibilities for educating the employees in order to cope with the results of the unrealized merger with AT&T and its negative effects. The higher ethical standards were proposed to change the situation within the company for better, and T-Mobile USA preserved the status of one of the highly ethical companies in the United States ( T-Mobile뗩 strong ethical culture , 2012).\\n\\nNevertheless, the question about the future challenges related to the corporate social responsibility of BP remains to be open. Thus, it is possible to answer it with references to the known facts and previous experience of the company. If BP does not change the approach to ethical standards and safety policies associated as well as the approach the corporate social responsibility, the further disasters will ruin the company뗩 reputation.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nFerrell, O., Fraedrich, J., & Ferrell, L.

I gripped the cherry lozenge in my pocket, which my younger brother Andrew had given to me, tightly, and with sweaty hands as I tried to breathe slowly and tell myself I had rehearsed thoroughly, and I had nothing to worry about. But in reality, I had everything to worry about. I could hear the sounds of a large crowd, although somewhat muffled, while behind the curtain. That velvet curtain was all that separated me from a large arena filled with people of different ages, races, and religions. The audience watched the velvet curtain as if they were expecting to witness an event as momentous as the Gettysburg Address or even for a person as great as Mahatma Gandhi, or even Martin Luther King Jr. to appear. I could not have compared myself to these two men, so how could I ever hope to inspire the crowd the way in which my predecessors had? As the curtains began to open, the spotlight's amber and yellow rays blinded me to the point where I could see nothing. After a matter of seconds, when my vision finally adjusted, I realized I had not been behind any curtain at all and that rather, I was in my bed and had merely been dreaming. The day I woke up from this dream was the day I decided I would be someone who is as great as those aforementioned men. I promised myself that I would stop at nothing to do something with my life that would leave the world a little better than the world I had woken up to on that day. (My passion for inspiring others fermented in me at a young age. As a child during the holiday of Hanukkah, I would wake up to the intoxicating smell of the Okra soup which my grandmother had brought with her from her native Morocco. After the large family meal, my brother and I would take it upon ourselves to put on a performance for the entire family. We would sing the traditional songs of our Moroccan heritage for our family during the holidays. After many years of singing together, my brother and I went on to perform for thousands of people via YouTube, and even went on to sing at Carnegie Hall.) Most people live life on the path set for them, too afraid to explore any other. But once in a people are inspired to make their lives everything they want it to be, and I hope to be a person who inspires others around me.\"),\n",

Let's start off and talk about the big picture, specifically location. Columbia University is located in New York, which is hugely appealing to me. Despite increasing globalization and change New York is still the center of the world. It's a center of commerce, creativity, and progress. It's the center of the world and I can't think of a better place to start out my life on my own. As for the school itself, Columbia's writing program is a huge draw for me. I'm not sure what I want to do professionally, but I love to write. I don't know if I want to write professionally, but I intend to continue to pursue it as a hobby and cathartic exercise. Columbia's renowned creative writing and journalism programs can help turn me into the writer I want to be. And beyond those two specific programs Columbia offers such a strong background in every other discipline. As stated previously I'm not sure what I want to study, but that's not a problem at Columbia. It's such an all around balanced and versatile school that I can be comfortable in the knowledge that whatever I fall in love with or decide to study will be offered in force at Columbia. It's a school that will give me a real chance to experiment and grow without the risk of backing the wrong academic horse. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Columbia is somewhere I'd be proud to go to school. To be picked as one of the select few who get to interact with Columbia's celebrated staff and elite students would be a privilege. I'd be a reminder of my own potential and reason to continue to do my best at everything I do, and become the person I want to be.\"),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Men\\'s clothing has traditionally followed military dress. Since military dress is generally restricted to only three or four uniforms, men generally only get a few different kinds of styles to choose from. Fashion designers have always tried to make men look manly, which stems directly from the military background because men in the military are considered very manly. Women\\'s dress was seen as a way to attract husbands, and so they\\'re often garish and exciting, which lead fashion designers to try to outdo each other in garishness and excitement.,\" \"You have to look at this on a case by case basis, some of these extra types of clothing have a knock-on effect. For example, pockets have never been popular in dresses and this has created a demand for handbags or clutches. Heels and skirts emphasise legs while serving no practical purpose for walking or protecting your legs from thorns or knees while kneeling. Women have traditionally been objectified as objects of visual attraction while men have traditionally been objectified as performers of manual labour. These clothing types conform to that and so much so that womens trousers still don\\'t have pockets (which is itself a knock-on effect of women carrying bags). Breasts are the central reason for the different types of tops for women. Tops are either opened at the chest in some way or hanging from the front or back to showemphasise something, again for beauty. For men most tops are functional, vests do emphasise muscle but it\\'s less common. Finally, since we are only just approaching real equality in the work place the business suit has driven mens fashion for decades or centuries.,\" \"The minimal business suit was a fashion trend that started with capitalism. The idea of capitalism was to let your money do the work for you. And buying expensive clothes for yourself is not making the money work for you. So non-capitalists you would wear fancy clothes to show how rich you were but capitalists would wear simpler clothes to show how well they were at handling money. And this is a trend that have only grown more and more. It was not long ago that the proper business attire included a hat and vest. And even now the tie is becoming optional. That is unless you drop the shirt and jacket all together and go for a nice sweater. The woman\\'s fashion options have remained more diverse. This was because women generally were not capitalists. So they were given more freedom in showing off how wealthy their husbands were. However there have been a lot of changes here as well and it is not that acceptable to wear big fancy dresses on a daily basis as it was back in the day. But if you go back 300 years both men and women would have similar width of options to chose from. Crazy suits with lots of intricate details similar to how ballroom dresses looks like were not uncommon among the rich men. And just as women have lots of different options for accenting their curves in the upper torso men had similar options for accenting their curves in the lower torso. High heals were first invented to be used by men.,Business attire is conservative. In the past women had much fewer choices and were required to wear dresses of a certain length and often of muted color (depending on position of course). As sexism started to get called out women began wearing pantsuits and other fashions to work. There\\'s a lot of options for men but since the goal is to stand out only very slightly in order to appear professional we really only get to express it in tie form. Unless you are in a \"creative\" type position people aren\\'t looking for how you want to express yourself. Artistic flare is seen as detracting from your ability to get the job done efficiently and professionally.'),\n",

How is that we have come to regard our childhood heroes as immoral villains? They are human and, as such, can make emotional decisions or take the wrong course of action. Villains always get the bad rep, but what about heroes? Why is it that no matter how hard some people try, they are often seldom received as the hero they truly are? Heroes can harbor malignant thoughts in the same way that villains can be upstanding citizens who were just caught on a bad day.

In the eighteen years of my existence I have lived among the ill, the disabled, and the unfortunate. I, personally, am a part of the disabled and have faced many challenges in my life. From the day of my diagnosis with Systemic Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis, Systemic ERA, I was told that I will never be able to succeed in life as this condition will hold me back, to a point where I can never function like a normal person. My goal was to prove this statement wrong. At the diagnosis of my condition I had to start methotrexate, chemotherapy, this challenged my life with uncontrollable bouts of sickness. My first year back to school with this disease, I missed sixty-three days of school and from that I knew my road in life would no longer be simple, but a constant struggle between balancing school, work, and my sickness. With my hopes dwindling, that I would never be able to function as a normal person, I was shown a summer camp with kids just like me with the same diseases and treatments. I attended this camp and took classes to deal with my arthritis in numerous ways to reduce the struggles upon my life, which resulted in me being able to stop all chemotherapy treatments as I took control of my life. This camp was a very influential part of my life as methods to deal with my illness are continuously used by me. On one of my later in life volunteer experiences, I volunteered at an elderly home. I entered the volunteer work just looking to complete volunteer credits and be done with such a program, but this home changed my life for all the days in my life to come. In that elderly home I was able to connect with people of conditions similar to mine as that of the summer camp. I showed them the same tricks that I was shown in my camp to reduce strain upon one's joints, to increase motion in the afflicted joints, and methods to reduce pain and suffering from one's self. After about a week all the seniors had gained new life and appeared to have washed away the sands of time from themselves. I enjoyed helping these elderly people and I feel I made a difference in their lives. On one day of work it was family day. It brought tears to my eyes when I saw grandparents running and playing with their grandchildren, something they had never been able to do before. This course of volunteer work was so influential upon me, I continued to help people through my life and continue to this day. I, to this very day, have had to deal with the challenges of life plus my condition. I was told that with my condition I would never be able to function like a normal person and I set out to prove them wrong. Furthermore, I believe I did what I said I would do. My personal gain from this life experience which I will grow with is that I have an absolute love of helping others. From this time I have decided that to be happy in life and to continue to endure happiness I need to be upon the end of giving help to others. So it would be in my benefit if I could be a doctor of any sort. I would be able to display my need to help others in way of challenging myself and proving that I can be normal by taking upon one of the hardest challenge of life, becoming a doctor that would benefit not only patients but in return myself.\"),\n",

While they officially say they are going after market share, there are two schools of thought as to why they are doing it.

The second school of thought is that this is about geopolitics.

Weak demand for oil means that the industries that use a lot of oil, energy production and transportation, are struggling. When people are using less energy to create goods and services, and there is less transport of goods, it is an indicator that the economy is weakening.

Additionally, for many countries with national oil companies (Norway, Brazil, Russia, and most of the Mid-East) that rely primarily on oil revenues to fund their governments, low prices means they can\\'t afford to pay for their programs.,\" \"If oil prices drop, that means that every other country in the world needs to have less US dollars in their reserve (all oil is internationally traded in us dollars. Regardless of who is buying or selling) So all of a sudden if prices drop, the US dollar is no longer as valuable, which means that the dollar could crash. Which would be bad. Edit: before anyone starts, I\\'m not saying it\\'s going to crash instantly. I\\'m saying that if oil drops in value enough, Or if everyone suddenly stopped trading in us dollars, the dollar would be in for a really bad time.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='A man with a red striped shirt and a hat, trying to blend in the crowd, hiding from society asks us to find him. So where is Waldo, really? Such a question leaves me in the deepest thought for the longest time. On the train, when I\\'m sleeping or when I\\'m eating. I\\'m practically living in the process of thinking about where Waldo really is. I mean, we all have played the game at one point or another but have we really stopped to think about where Waldo is? At a definitive point in time? No, because he does not exist in one place. He is everywhere; at the beach, in the far east of China, the playground or the jungle. Waldo is not just a person we see in a childish game. He is not someone we can grasp onto and say we found him. Waldo is metaphorically our inner desire and devotion. He is the embodiment of the dreams of people around the world waiting to be found. We are given an image of what we want to find, a blurred, far off idea, but the process of finding it is up to us. The journey, the obstacles in the way and fate plays a part in the game. Many of us think finding and pursuing an education and a career to be a game. That\\'s finding Waldo for them. Through clicks and tremulous hours of looking for a figure engraved in our head, we might have mistakenly thought somebody else was Waldo. In life, many people pursue a career for fame and money but not for love and passion. That\\'s a mistaken glimpse of Waldo, not truly him but just somebody who emulates him. Like a kid who plays with firefighter action figures or a man with a desire to go to the moon, they are waiting to find their Waldo. In fact, Waldo is not a single noun; it\\'s a collective of everyone\\'s hopes and desires. As babies, we don\\'t know what we desire yet, it is as we experience life and grow older do we grow wiser about decisions and the paths we want to take. The inner Waldo is hiding in a crowd of people, or rather an unconscious thought waiting for you to realize it. Every Waldo found contributes ideas to the world, big or small. It creates a diverse, cooperating world of thinkers and philosophical workers who make the world a better place. The world as we know it composes of people who found Waldo, waiting to find Waldo or doesn\\'t know of a Waldo to be found yet. Those three kinds of people exists somewhere or another. It could be a friend, a family member or even you. So, next time you sit down in your leisure time to play \"Where\\'s Waldo?\" think about your life and reflect on it. That\\'s where Waldo really is. Inside your mind. I probably have a lot of grammar and issues, so please help revise it ! Lt;3, Thanks!'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Sociological Perspective on Punishment as a Major Contributor to Child Abuse Essay\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nPunishment is seen as a way through which parents, teachers and the society use in their efforts to instill discipline in their children. There is a general acceptance that there is a level of punishment that can be legitimized what sociologists have referred to as normal punishment. However, there is no set way of measuring the level that is appropriate. This paper examines from a sociological perspective how the ideology that normal punishment is legitimate has contributed to child abuse (Sherman 77).\\n\\nReinforcement of Normal Punishment\\n\\nDiscipline Though Inflicting Pain\\n\\nParents, day care centers, house girls, teachers and the society have for long been punishing children by inflicting pain, especially when the child has done what is believed to be wrong. This is done with the aim of ensuring that the child is disciplined and is perceived as a legitimate punishment. In the process of punishing, the parents end up abusing the child. In most cases physical punishment is seen as a way of parenting. A child should be disciplined and it뗩 the responsibility of the parent to set the required standards. However, this punishment, it is often excessive and thus an abuse. What is not excessive is subject to debate.\\n\\nParents as Role Models\\n\\nThe parent are seen as role models to the children and thus any advise given to the children is seen as the gospel truth and children are not supposed to question it. This has offered a loophole to parents to abuse the child in the name of punishing. For example, children learn mainly through interaction with other children through playing their various social games. This is a very important exercise in a child뗩 life, however some parents deny their children time or restrict them, in the name of advising, from exercising this important socialization process, it may be direct where children are locked in the house or strictly forbidden from going outside. Others restrict their child on the children they are expected to play with. On the indirect perspective parents line up numerous duties to be performed by the child either homework or a never ending tuition, all this geared to deny a child free time. This has a psychological effect on the child in the short term and sometimes in the long run (Geffner and Hughes 65).\\n\\nThird Parties\\n\\nIn incidences of rape, the culprits are mainly relatives, close family members and the neighbors, this is because our society has mandated the culprits with the perceived right to discipline the child. In the process of punishing the child end뗩 up abused.\\n\\nIn our schools from kindergartens, primary schools, and secondary schools punishment by the teacher is seen as a normal legitimate process. This has in many societies ended up misunderstood and since no level is set on the punishment acceptable, it is in most cases abused. On the other hand, since the child is made to understand that punishing him or her is good, they keep quiet and the vise continues (Loseke 121).\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nIt is everyone뗩 mandate to ensure that a child is disciplined for a better society tomorrow. However, we have an extra role to play, that is, to ensure that no one violates this responsibility and as the saying goes- 랎o protect a child is to protect the world. This emphasizes the need to protect the child for continuity. Governments should also put in place measures to ensure children뗩 rights are protected.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nGeffner R.

       " Document(page_content='Please kindly help me improve my IELTS writing. Thank you very much for your help.  \\n  \\n*It is inevitable that as technology advances, traditional cultures will be lost. It seems that we cannot have these two things together. To what extent do you agree or disagree?* (At least 250 words - IELTS essay)  \\n  \\n## how to protect our tradition?\\n\\n  \\n  \\nIt has been argued by many that the development of technology has a strong correlation with the extinction of traditional values. Although modern technology and tradition are two contrast values to some extent, the co-existence of the both values should be considered essential.  \\n  \\nThe first reason is that the preservation of traditional values is strongly promoted by the state-of-the-art technology. In fact, cultural heritage of a nation is promoted by the emergence of online platforms. For instance, since the traditional products made by the ethnic minorities in Vietnam have been recently introduced by social media, an increase in the number of tourists who visited Vietnam has been witnessed for the last 5 years. The growing technology, in addition, has contributed to the preservation of traditional values. For illustrative purposes, if the Vietnamese government did not use the advanced technology to undertake the restoration work of Notre Dame Cathedral, the young generation would not have a chance to visit the place in their lifetime.  \\n  \\nSecondly, the co-operation of both traditional values and technology is considered essential for the economic development of any nation. First, by using latest technology, tourism companies are able to generate higher income from tourists in terms of cultural activities and related services. For example, in the era of digital technology, the 3D platform has been applied in numerous activities of cultural experiences, which attracts more customers and generates higher revenue. The application of technology in the preservation of traditional values, moreover, will bring significant benefits for the growth of any industry. There is an increasing trend of using technology in the mass production of traditional products, which increased the quantities of exported goods of Vietnam by 30% in the last 3 years, according to the latest report conducted by Department of High Technology of Vietnam.  \\n  \\nIn conclusion, modern technology and traditional values should exist together because of a variety of aforementioned reasons. The government should undertake strategic plans to protect traditions by using latest forms of technology.  \\n  \\nWord count: 329 words'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='There are always peple saying that aliens are alive and maybe that there is going to be an alien invasion. In 1976, a Mars Global surveyor (MGS) found an image of a peron or as MGS says a \"a Viking photo.\" I believe the image of the Viking is just a landform and it wasn\\'t created by aliens. I will explain to you why i think it\\'s a landform.\\n\\nI believe the image is a just a landform because scientists haven\\'t discovered life yet on mars even though they have found water on Mars. In paragraph 2, the author states, \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydnia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah.\" I agree with this statement because if the Martian mesa was made again, that means that they will be around for a long time and it will never disappear. The author also states that people think the image or the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars. By the looks of the images, I could see that every year they have taken it, I can see that it\\'s disappearing. In the introduction, it says, \"New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA\\'s Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is is: A mesa.\" If people want evidence of aliens or other creatures, they will have to do research on their spare time because scientists have a job to do and they will only do what they are ordered to do. Just to be clear, when they took the photos of the Face on 1976,1998, and 2001, the technology wasn\\'t as advanced as it is today but, if we take a photo of it today, I believe there will probably be another one of the landfoms or probably we might see the Face but just slowly disappearing. These were some of my reasons to argue with to support my belief of the Face being a natural landform.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the image of the Face was just a myth and I will never say it was created by aliens. Aliens aren\\'t even real, that hasn\\'t benn confirmed or said. Not one scientist has said that they have seen a living creature on any planet walking or doing anything. These were just rumors and it can be said as a myth if people want. Based on these reasons, I believe the Face is just a natural landform on Mars.    '),\n",

I think students should be allowed to use there phones during class, I think we should be allowed to use any electronic or wireless device. Sometimes we have nothing to do at all so why cant we just text are friends or listen to are ipod's they don't bother anyone at all. Teacher's should only take them up if there being a distraction to other student's but other than that they don't bother anyone. Another thing were always on are phones anyway' s, people always text in class even though there not suppose to there is no purpose for these kids not to have there electronics out what if it's an emergency? Then we should have them out without teacher's yelling and doing what they do when we have them out. Lunch is a perfect hour to have them out I know it would make us less loud because we'd be entertained with are electronics. Everyone take them out anyway' s and just hide them when a teacher or anyone that might take it up come by. I think we should just try it and see how it goes, if we decide to make a bad decision we get are privilege taken away.\\n\\nWhen it's time for class we put them up, and concentrate. For a fact I know I would be concentrated and quiet if I can listen to my ipod during a test or study time as for my phone I would only pull that out if I got a text or A call. Phone's should be allowed because are parents bought it for us to use not to just have in a bag or pocket to look cute, like we can dye are hair or wear accessories we can have are phones out there's no point of us not having are electronic' s out. If we don't want to listen we wont it's are choice, Whoever made this law up not to have electronics out is a hypocrite because for a fact he or she's writing it on a laptop, has his or hers phone out calling his or her' s employees or co-workers. The government sale's these electronics and now they want to say we can't use them in certain places it's pointless. It's like a drug addict wants to do drugs but he cant do it in this country even though he's doing it anyways if they say we have the freedom to do what we want in this country we should stand up for are right's and have are electronics out.

These artifacts provide evidence of capacities I have developed during my studies.\\n\\nFirst, I would like to compare between OCD PART 2 BISMCS 234 Media & Communication Technique and Is This Chair Taken? B ARTS 151 Intro to Acting. Final Scene. The two videos I have made demonstrate my video production skills. Compare and contrast analysis of the two video projects demonstrate that in 춺OCD PART 2 BISMCS 234 Media & Communication Technique, I completed in 2016 shows my considerable progress in the video-production area as compared to the second video I have made in the year 2015.\\n\\nBeing specific, I need to mention that my progress is demonstrated by the following achievements: I have learned how to make cuts, insert background music, develop transitions, and choose the angle. I have also improved my sound recording skills as compared to the video made in 2015.\\n\\nAddressing my written project What Does Media and Communication Teach Us about Copyright and Fair Use?, I will need to focus on my writing skills development as well as my writing skills in English, specifically because English is my second language and, of course, I have to strive hard to achieve progress in this area. As for my writing skills in general, the paper demonstrates that I have mastered MLA citation style, have learned how to develop essay structure with its essential parts of the introduction, main body, and conclusion, transitions, and thesis statement positioning.\\n\\nIn addition, the written project 춺What Does Media and Communication Teach Us about Copyright and Fair Use? provided me with an opportunity to explore the topic that seems to be of great importance in the United States. I must confess that earlier, and I did not have an awareness of copyright and fair use matters in the media. However, the given project has provided me with a chance to fill this gap. Conducting my research and organizing my thoughts into a coherent and cohesive piece of writing, I have learned that current copyright laws have provided a considerable measure of protection for authors being in danger of copyrighting rights infringement due to abuse on the Internet. However, I have also found out that further improvements are needed because there are still many areas that lack regulations to control fair use matters.\\n\\nIn conclusion, assessment of the three chosen artifacts I have created during my studies has indicated that I have made considerable progress in the area of video production capabilities and writing art. I have also mastered the new skills of expressing my inner world with the use of video-making tools. In addition, I have improved my research skills to expand my world-vision and develop my intellectual plant.

       " Document(page_content=\"In high school I had planned to attend San Francisco State and to leave Los Angeles as soon as I had graduated. However, even though I had been accepted, my brother told me not to move away from my mother and my friends. I thought it would be easy to spend two years at Santa Monica College and then transfer to a UC. College proved more difficult than I had expected. At eighteen, having the freedom to set my own priorities meant that I did not put my studies first when needed. I did not think it was wrong to take advantage of a sunny day, to spend time outside or to spend time learning a new talent. Because my mother had not gone to high school, and I was the first in my family to plan to attend a four-year university, I had not known about or developed the study skills that I needed for the college success. I refused to get help because I didn't want to admit that I needed help. My mother praised me for studying hard, but made me feel guilty if I missed family events. I wanted to be self-sufficient and thought that I could always go home and figure out anything that I had trouble with. However, to support myself, I'm working as a lifeguard from when classes ended until 9 at night, and then I rarely had the energy to continue studying. During this time, I saw my grades drop lower than they ever had. I was not proud of my progress and I realized that I needed to make a change. I began seeing my TRIO counselor, Tomas Rojas, more. He saw my interests and helped me to make a schedule, so I would give myself time to study and still do the things I loved doing. I learned to go to tutors and counselors when I needed help with something, rather than trying to do it or learn it on my own. I began doing my homework at the library or a caf칠, instead of doing it at home where I would be disturbed. It didn't happen overnight, but developing these skills gave me the ability to succeed in my classes. More importantly, I began to gain self-confidence-I learned I wasn't stupid or a bad student. It helped me get the most out of the classes that I was interested in and to be able to choose a major-Art History-that I feel truly passionate about and able to pursue.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Growing up in a two-bedroom apartment, along with a single parent, three siblings and four cousins I was always depressed. I never had new shoes, new clothes, new toys just to have. Everything I had in my reach I had to share along with my relatives. Going nights without electricity, sometimes no food, or water just so my mother can save up her hard-earned checks to get the bills paid became a regular activity. Sometimes having to sleep on our rug just to stay warm. Not only can we not bathe, but we\\'d have to sear some clothes that doesn\\'t look filthy over and over until electricity start back working. My mom often thought that if we go to the wash house we\\'ll be wasting money that we could use on bills. So after constantly doing the same routines over and over we got adjusted to it, not thinking there was a way out. I begin to think that\\'s how everyone lived. Until my mother was promoted, and all bills were getting paid on time. Ignoring the picking everyone used to do I kept my grades up. Growing up I learned keeping good grades was the best way to get into an awesome college. Later on I realized I was on my way going down the right path. As a child, hearing the term \"The Good Life\" I often thought of being rich, having an unlimited amount of money. Living in a million dollar homes, and driving million-dollar cars. Honestly, I thought of everything only a celebrity would be able to afford. Not only wealth, everyone is happy with no worries. More like, people spending money constantly. Furthermore, now as I\\'m maturing in age I think of the Good Life as maintaining. Maintaining as in keeping a roof over your head, food and water, electricity, and a vehicle to get you from point A to B and back to A. I used to think the type of car mattered, but as I\\'ve grown I\\'ve learned that\\'s just for a publicity stunt. I know as I become a freshman in college that would be my first step into preparing for the good life. I would have to do my best at every assignment I\\'m assigned to complete. Furthermore, I\\'d have to take advantage of every opportunity they throw at me. Interns, volunteering, etc. During, I\\'ll have to set long term and short term goals, making it my job to reach them. My main focus during this undergraduate stage is to challenge myself. I know it would be for the better. Knowing that I would be living In a dorm I would become more sociable. Also, I would become extremely organized, keeping myself on a specific time schedule, and putting my homework and classwork before outside activity. I know abiding by the rules will discipline me.

       " Document(page_content='I think I just drew a masterpiece. My portrait in front of me truly pictures how I will look as a doctor. My eyes are shining with kindness. My glasses radiate intelligence. I have a smile that says confidence, a neat haircut that emits focus, and, of course, a long white doctor\\'s coat that speaks professionalism and experience. But then, I accidentally dropped this picture into the X-ray machine! I stared disheartened, as all my superficial features vanished; it is replaced with 78 organs, 208 bones, and over 600 muscles. Then, three parts stood out to me: the hands, brain, and heart. A doctor\\'s hands perform miracles. Therefore, it needs to be fast and agile. I think my hands are up to the task. Playing the piano since I was four, they have had ample exercise. While in elementary school, I impressed my fellow students and teachers during the talent shows playing songs by Beethoven and Mozart. My teachers remarked, \"Keep your hands safe; they will do great things in the future.\" I agree, but instead of entertainment, I want my hands to heal. As a doctor, I will be handy in any situation. A doctor\\'s brain makes life or death decisions. A doctor has to not only think fast but also think with from different perspectives. Thinking from the patient\\'s standpoint is just as important as thinking as a doctor. I believe my insatiable hunger for knowledge will assist me in becoming a doctor. In my senior year, I am taking four A.P. courses: Physics, Calculus, U.S. Government, and English Literature. While I love math and science, English confuses me to no end. Yet, I was compelled to take all four classes because I know each subject has its own merit. I believe focusing on a single subject will only blind me from other areas. It is this inspiration that also lead me to take college courses in Sociology and Psychology. In fact, I will be taking another course, \"Introduction to Philosophy,\" on January 29th. I chase these opportunities because I want to expand my horizon. With a more knowledgeable background, I know I will be able to make better decisions as a doctor. The heart is the most important part of being a doctor. After all, doctors cure patients and not diseases. It is important to be compassionate to patients. In fact, it is my love for helping others that helped me choose the medical field. I discovered this passion while volunteering at Clove Lakes Rehabilitation Center. It was the connection I felt with the residents and staffs that really inspired me. The residents would occasionally come up to me and thank me. One of my bosses even told me that he always looks forward to summers because that is when volunteers come. Whether it was helping residents in wheelchairs or lessening the workload of staff members, the ability to see the gratification on their faces filled me with joy. It is this same fervor that I will bring to the medical field. I know that I will strive to put my patient\\'s welfare first. Thank you for reading my essay. Any comments will be greatly appreciated. Please be critical in pointing out tone, structural, or grammatical errors. I tried to make my essay stand out but is the beginning too hard to understand? TY and Happy New Year!'),\n",

Knowing how long this trip was going to be, I put in my headphones and loaded up some music, got as comfortable in the seat as I could, and prepared myself for another long drive into the vast boredom of the flat side of Virginia. Somewhere between Pink Floyd and Alice in Chains, I noticed her. Nothing too special, really. I saw her get on the bus, and wrote her off as a six or low seven. Cliche and male, I know, but hell, I was a teenager. What more do you expect? Anyway, this girl, she\\'s looking at me with intent. Ever heard the term \" hungry eyes \"? That was her in a nutshell, my friend. She had a rather average face, was a bit pudgy, but with what had to have been double d\\'s. I smiled to her, and she slid into the seat beside me. I\\'ve never really been a hit with the ladies, but I as we started talking, I realized that this girl was different. Outside the window, the sun had all but disappeared behind the trees, painting the sky in streaks of red and purple, and I knew that it was time. A move must be made. The kiss was deep and warm; she was skilled in it, but I wasn\\'t. She spent around a half hour teaching me, her hands creeping onto my neck and chest, exploring. My heartbeat was fast and loud, a drumroll in my veins. She gave coy little smiles and giggles in the dark, slipping her hands lower and lower until they found purchase bellow my belt. I closed my eyes and melted in her grip as she worked me with her hands, all the while with those little giggles. Then, with the suddenness of a car crash, it was over. She left me hanging there, unfinished, as the bus rolled to a halt. She walked away with a piece of my heart that night, out into the distance of memory. I collected my things and used them to awkwardly hide myself until I made it to the sanctity of my house. I offloaded my stuff into my room and prepared to take a shower and finish what she started. Stripping down, however, I found one last surprise from her: my fleshy teenage love-stick and his two sidekicks were shining, shimmering, and reflecting light like the still waters of a lake. I was numb with shock and surprise; how did this happen? Why me? What cruel game was this girl playing at, doing such a thing to me? She gave me the glitterballs. Turned my junk into a set of disco balls, dangling and jangling with shiny abandon. The shower was hot and thorough, but could not wash the stain from my soul.'),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Drivelss cars should not be developed because they can cause accidents, they can cause the driver not to pay attetnion, and they would cost more.\\n\\nDrivelss cars aren\\'t really driveless. At certain points they will need the drivers assistance. This can lead to many accidents. In paragraph 9, the text states \"most driving laws focus on keeping dirvers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers.\" The sentence proves that driveless cars may not be completely safe. The driver could depend on the car to drive itself and not be paying attention which can result in accidents. In paragraph 9, it also states that it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars. Something would not be illegal if it\\'s comepletely safe.\\n\\nAnother reason driveless cars should not be developed is becasue they can cause the drive not to pay attention. Driveless cars would be like phones. They made driving and texting illegal because it made the drivers not pay attention and caused many death and accidents. The same result can come form drivelss cars. They can be a great distraction becasue the driver would think that the car can drive itlsef and they would not pay attention. From that conclusion, in paragraph 9, the question \"If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer\" would come up. Who would be responsible? If the driver belived the car can drive itself and the techonology failed, it can lead to death because the driver might not be paying attention.

       " Document(page_content='Comparing and Contrasting the Virginia and New Jersey plans Report\\n\\nThe Virginia Plan had proposed a bicameral legislative plan to favor states with high human population and disfavor the states in the United State with small population. Each states number of representatives in the two chamber were determined by percentages of the state뗩 contribution, the national contribution and population size quotas, to the national development (Madison Debate 13; Madison Debate 15).\\n\\nThe states with high population supported the Virginia plan. However, the states with low population, which feared losing the self-governance powers, opposed it. Instead, they embraced the New Jersey plan. The New Jersey plan was single chambered. Every state had a single vote regardless of its size as stipulated under Article of Confederation (Madison Debate 13; Madison Debate 15).\\n\\nVirginia Plan\\n\\nBranches\\n\\nThe Virginia plan had three legislative branches, which include legislative, executive, and judicial. The legislature was more powerful than others as it was authorized to elect the executive and judicial sections (Madison Debate 13).\\n\\nLegislatures\\n\\nTwo parliamentary houses characterized the Virginia plan of the legislature where citizens elected the members of the House of Representatives while the legislature elected the Senate (Madison Debate 13).\\n\\nSupplementary Supremacies\\n\\nThe Virginia plan allowed United State the powers to regulate any trade happening between the states, abolish unconstitutional laws, and authorize armed forces to put into effect any law (Madison Debate 13).\\n\\nNew Jersey\\n\\nBranches\\n\\nThe New Jersey plan had three legislature branches, which consists of legislative, executive, and the judicial. The legislature appointed members working in the executive branch. The executive branch elected those working as justices in the Supreme Court (Madison Debate 15).\\n\\nLegislature\\n\\nThe New Jersey plan of legislature was unicameral. Representation of single states was equal to ensure no state was exercising higher power than other states in the United State (Madison Debate 15).\\n\\nSupplementary Supremacies\\n\\nThe New Jersey plan required the United State to approve the national legislature to authorize laws powerful than the laws of any state in the United State and impose levies, import duties, and control inter-states trade.\\n\\nMy Opinion\\n\\nThe New Jersey plan allowed more power to the new federal government. The New Jersey plan of the United State government disallowed the state with high population to acquire higher powers than the states with poor population.\\n\\nBesides, it opposed employment of the two parliamentary chambers. This enhanced meaningful political reforms. By this plan, there occurs reduction in incidents negatively affecting the state when making those political transformations.\\n\\nFurthermore, the New Jersey plan ensured the power between individual states was equal. It was a copy of the current state of the powers in the United Nations in emphasizing the fact that individual states were independent states.\\n\\nA state freely and individually joined the United State. Therefore, other states in the United State should not interfere with her powers due to indifferences in population size. It also allowed the United State to regulate trade and taxes charged within every United State member (Madison Debate 13; Madison Debate 15).\\n\\nHowever, single benefit was forgone in the New Jersey plan. For instance, having the two parliamentary chambers would provide benefit to the states, especially when the government is performing poorly in the economic growth. That is, the bicameral legislation plan would provide checks and adequate balance, which withholds the passing of poorly determined legislations.\\n\\nBibliography\\n\\nMadison Debate 13 .

For this reason, everyone tries to attain success and promote the further development of personality. However, there are numerous challenges a person might face while trying to improve his/her position in society. It is a complicated process that is comprised of numerous ups and downs. Besides, it is crucial to realize the fact that failure is an integral part of the life of a human being, and it helps to acquire the new experience and reconsider some approaches.\\n\\nRevolving around the issue, one could remember his/her own failure. Sometimes it is rather painful and could result in disappointment and despair. Moreover, failure can make a person abandon some projects and accept his/her helplessness. As for me, I had a number of painful downs in my life, which impacted my personality and triggered a certain change process. However, at first, I was rather vulnerable, and any failure was a great tragedy. I was sure that it resulted from my inability to perform a certain kind of activity and evidenced the necessity of giving up. Yet, very soon, I realized that this approach could ruin my life and deprive me of any perspectives.\\n\\nThis recognition of this idea resulted in the reconsideration of my approach towards success and its main components. The fact is that failure is one of the major concerns related to the issue. However, it does not prove our weakness. It just serves as evidence that the chosen method or approach is not efficient enough to achieve the needed goal. In this regard, it is vital to analyze the main reasons that conditioned fiasco to acquire clear knowledge about the weaknesses of the plan and skill gaps. This investigation will promote a better understanding of the main vectors of the development of personality needed to become successful.\\n\\nRevolving around my own experience, failures in various projects served as the positive reinforcement for me. I was not able to accept the idea that there were things not available to me. The absence of the result just evidenced the lack of preparation and the necessity of some additional effort. In this regard, the reconsideration of my personal attitude towards the issue promoted the significant improvement of my personality.\\n\\nFor instance, critical writing has always been one of my weak points, and I experienced a number of failures in the given sphere. Besides, realizing the necessity of writing skills and the impact they have on my further personal and professional development, I made efforts to improve this aspect. Analyzing my previous failures, I highlighted the weak points and created the plan to get rid of nagging mistakes. This fact evidences my own attitude towards failures and the necessity of their acceptance.\\n\\nIn conclusion, one should realize the fact that failure is not the sign of helplessness or the absence of any positive aspects. It just shows a person that he/she should work harder to attain success and contribute to his/her personal and professional development. In this regard, we should try to analyze them and determine the major concerns related to a certain issue or project as the lessons we take from failures are fundamental to later success.\\n'),\n",

Rice University was set at #15 most beautiful campus in the US, yet, I felt like it should have been set at least among Top 5. I recalled my teacher having mentioned Rice as a great engineering school, and looking at its campus simply made me more intrigued. I began a deeper research on Rice and discovered that it was more than just a beautiful campus. Its engineering ranking and overall curriculum and activities is what primarily caught my attention by the end. Ever since then, I began a \"look-out\" for Rice at any chance I had. Whether it was at a college fair or college informational sessions at school, Rice was always in my radar. Through conversations with Rice alumni and representatives, I soon saw that Rice was and still is my ideal school. It is set among a beautiful campus, it is a small school, which makes it easier to learn, and its contributions to the STEM field have been revolutionary - contributions which I would like to be a part of in the future.

Feudalism and serfdom ruled the world for a very long time, and this gave real power only to the nobility. (And even then not always all of them.) Lord Bumblewant or whatever owned some large fief, and if you lived on that land you were one of his people. You had to pay him rent and he he was the ruler of the land in all ways that mattered, and the next ruler would usually be his firstborn son. In proper serfdom you didn't have to pay rent, you were literally property of your lord and he could force you to do anything he pleased. It wasn't until 1918 that a man could, regardless of his wealth, vote in the UK for example. They were a bit late in that, plenty of other countries came earlier but nonetheless for the most part in the Western world it wasn't until the 19th or 20th century that all men could expect a vote even if they weren't nobility, land-owners or otherwise more than just citizens.,Everything began to change massively around the enlightenment and the industrial revolution.

       " Document(page_content=\"Some people think that there should be strict laws to control the amount of noise a person makes because of the disturbance it causes to people.Discuss the advantages and disadvantages.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.As population grows and society expands, noise pollution inevitably occurs more often and worse. This concept triggered some people to start thinking that there oughts to be strict regulations on how much noise each individual can make in order to minimise the harmful effect on other people. In this essay, I will discuss both advantages and disadvantages of the regulations and suggest whether it is beneficial or not after all.\\nOne of the advantages if strict laws are applied is that it is the easiest and most effective way of solving the problem in a short term. The noise level of human population will significantly drop as being loud becomes an illegal action to carry out. For instacne, even imposing a fine due to excessive sound one made can strongly discourage him or her from making loud noises ever again. Furthermore, people's standard of living will most likely to be enhanced as there are less disturbance caused by noise. People will be able to enjoy quiet, relaxing weekends even in central cities, for example.\\nIn contrast to the preceding positive outcomes, there are disadvantages due to the strict laws such as too much restrictions on people. The laws can be considered as rather aggressive and coercive since people's some daily life routines may get spoiled. Some hobbies like singing and even special cases like emergency situations will confront some problems if such laws become real. Moreover, it is almost impractical to set up the standard of 'loud' noise or even measuring the decibels individulas make all the time. Society would get rather intensive and monotonous once the laws controlling the sound level are implemented.\\nIn summary, despite the efficient aspects of the laws, it is more important to acknowledge the negative sides such as stress individuals suffer from strict regulations or damages on their lifestyle. Noise pollution should be resolved through more friendly means like advertisement rather than inflexible laws.\"),\n",

Adam Scorer was speaking after it emerged that the Grenfell Tower fire started in a Hotpoint fridge-freezer. Some 79 people are feared dead. He told 5 Live\\'s Wake Up to Money that while councils were responsible for trading standards, there was no central system to relay information about products to the public. \"Consumers should be confident that most products are safe, but we do know that the regime is as strong as its weakest link,\" Mr Scorer said. \"We don\\'t have a central organisation of technical resources, we don\\'t have core funding where we can be sure of who is going to be around to do this testing, and we don\\'t have the right level of strategic communication to make sure that risks are placed on the system, flags are alerted and people are able to go in and do the right level of investigation of all the products that are concerned.\" Former Business Secretary Sir Vince Cable told the programme that trading standards were a problem area because they were not a statutory obligation of local government. \"There are some things local government is required to do - trading standards not so,\" he said. \"So when local councils are under financial pressure it is something they can cut back on.\" Although the Department of Business provides PS15m annually for national trading standards activities, the vast majority of services are funded by local authorities. The departments were once known as Weights and Measures. Sir Vince suggested imposing an obligation on local authorities to strengthen trading standards, adding: \"Or you could give them some financial support, which I think is what we should be probably doing, to have some ring-fenced money that supports what is currently a declining service.\" He was Business Secretary when former BBC presenter Lynn Faulds-Wood was commissioned to investigate product safety. She claims the government ignored her report. \"I think Lynn Faulds-Wood\\'s concern is she made recommendations that were very modest and did not entail public cost, [but] even they have not been acted on and that was where she is enormously frustrated.\" Sir Vince added: \"There is a tendency at the moment to look at whether the costs are to business rather than whether the costs are to society as a whole.\" A Department for Business spokesperson said: \"Funding and prioritisation for trading standards are decisions for local authorities - accountable to local communities and the people they serve.

Despite multiple efforts to reduce inequality, this country experiences multiple challenges. African citizens face inequality due to an unequal distribution of opportunities, existing religious disparities, and the impact of gender factors.\\n\\nAfrica is known for its cultural diversity due to its distribution of opportunities that are never the same for all regions. The countries with similar geographical locations or access to natural resources, like C칪te d뗄voire, Nigeria, or Namibia, differ in their investors, which explains their cultural inequality. A variety of languages, exchange of experience, and history of tribes determine disparity at different levels.\\n\\nAnother example of how cultural inequality affects human lives in Africa is based on the existing religious disparities. There are more than 3000 tribes in the country that rely on their cosmology, the history of tribes, and the development of nations. Ideological problems, social values, and interpersonal relationships shape an understanding of cultural issues and make people prefer various stories and lifestyles in their everyday activities.\\n\\nGender diversity may also be the reason for cultural inequality in Africa. Although the population of this country is equally proportionate between males and females, women obtain fewer chances to stabilize their lives and deal with poverty. Women have less political power and support in many African countries, which leads to additional cultural impacts and social consequences.\\n\\nIn general, cultural inequality in Africa is a burning question due to the associated outcomes and influences. In addition to differences in gender roles and opportunities, religious beliefs define inequality and disturb populations. In my opinion, inequality culture is an integral element of the continent뗩 development, and its understanding is required to learn an African style of life.\\n'),\n",

In 1938, the government issued ID cards for the Jews and forced them to use their Jewish Surnames for easy identification.\\n\\nIn 1938, the government implemented a policy of racial expulsion that was meant to remove all the Jews from Germany. When the Nazi occupied Poland in 1939, the policy of emigration could not be carried out since the Polish Jews represented a significant portion of the population. By the start of the Second World War in 1939, the Nazi regime was seeking a final solution to what it considered to be 랎he Jewish Problem.\\n\\nAnti-Semitism was one of the key ideologies adopted by the Nazi Party from its formation in 1919. The Nazi were convinced that the once strong Aryan race had been weakened by mixing with other races. The Jews were singled out as the race that had led to the decline of the German society.\\n\\nNazi leaders proposed that Germany could only be restored to its previous prestige and power if it got rid of the Jewish community living in the country. Due to the anti-Semitism ideology, the Nazi regime was able to carry engage in the persecution of German Jews immediately after Hitler took power. The ideology led to the issuing of hundreds of decrees that were aimed at segregating the Jews and eventually expelling them from Germany.\\n\\nThe Jewish began to experienced violence as soon as Hitler뗩 Nazi Party took power in 1933. The Nazi Regime had anti-Semitic ideologies and it encouraged violence against the Jews. However, the Nazi opted to use legislation in addition to the anti-Jewish violence. The legislation option was taken since it enabled the government to justify its discriminative action against a segment of its population. Legislation provided the government with an excuse to carry out oppressive action against the Jewish community.\\n\\nThrough legislation, the Nazi Regime was able to carry out the large scale persecution of the Jewish community with the support and even collaboration of most of the German population. The legal restrictions were imposed on Jews and other groups of the society that were considered to be inferior. These restrictions were in line with the Nazi ideology that the Aryan race was superior to the other races. To keep the Aryan race pure and strong, the restrictions discriminated against the mentally and physically disabled. By engaging in eugenics, the Nazi regime hoped to create a superior race.\\n\\nNazi anti-Jewish policy got progressively worse from 1933. At the beginning, the Jews suffered from limited violence and they were able to live and work in the country. However, as the policies got worse, the Jews were prevented from working in certain institutions and their ability to conduct business was curtailed. Their citizenship rights were dissolved leaving them vulnerable to more persecution. The European Jews adopted a strategy of emigration to escape from Nazi persecution.\\n\\nAt the onset, the Nazi Regime encouraged the Jews to leave the country. However, over the years, the government started imposing policies that were aimed at restricting Jewish movement. High taxes were imposed on Jews who sought to leave the country making it hard for many to escape. In 1941, the government officially banned Jewish emigration leaving many trapped in the country.\\n'),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Emergence of the Human and Health Science Essay\\n\\nDarwin뗩 evolution theory of natural selection explains how different organisms came to being and how others got extinct. In the theory, evolution occurred from one generation to another as they inherited physical and behavioral traits that allowed them to thrive in rapidly changing environments. This theory starts by indicating that in the olden days, there existed organisms with opposing traits i.e., either strong or weak traits. Geological and other environmental changes impacted the need for the survival of the species. As a result, the organisms with stronger particular traits would remain alive and end up passing the traits to their next generations as they breed. The organisms with weaker traits would get wiped out naturally resulting in the extinction of their generation (Flew 28). Darwin뗩 theory of evolution was fundamental in discussing the unique occurrences and developments in human sciences. The theory in itself explains genetics despite the lack of its knowledge at the time of its formation.\\n\\nWhen relating the theory to the concept of human, life and the science surrounding it, it is clear to note how humans have made significant advancements in science with the intent of developing their world, remaining dominant, and understanding every concept of life to keep them ahead of anything that may want to wipe them out of the face of the world. Understanding the working of the human brain gives a clear indication of how the brain is so developed as compared to other organisms and why humans remain superior to other organisms. This explains why in every century, new developments are made and new scientific studies are identified giving a difference to the world.\\n\\nScientific Questions Supporting Connection of Darwin뗩 Theory and Human Sciences\\n\\nOne of the scientific questions is the origin of life and the extinction of some species. This question is used to identify the origin of humanity and the variation in the organisms that exist now to those that existed in the earlier centuries e.g., mammoths. It also tries to find out of humanity will last or we are also likely to go extinct. Through the process of obtaining answers, one can understand how evolution has contributed to changes in the life of different organisms as well as humans and how humans have gone to a great extent to dig deeper into the existence and development of life. The other scientific questions include:\\n\\n 1. In what way has the secret of life been unravelled through time? (How different people have tried to study and sustain life).\\n 2. How unique is the human brain and what is its role in the human body? (History of the study of the human brain and how the obtained information has been used in the development of the field of psychology and neuroanatomy).\\n 3. How does the brain impact our lives? (This explains the variation in brain development at different ages and among different individuals).\\n\\nProof of the Existence of A Link Between Science and Society\\n\\nThe videos indicate how information grew from one century to another and was built on the inventions of key researchers and enthusiasts. All the information was used as guiding principles in the different scientific fields and new information was added to the existing data. The changes observed from one century to another are majorly contributed by scientific advancement. Countries such as Britain that took science seriously rapidly advanced and adapted to the rapidly changing environments as compared to other countries and this is an indicator of the link of science and the society.\\n\\nWork Cited\\n\\nFlew, Antony.

       " Document(page_content='Zora Neale Hurston, Her Biography and Works Essay\\n\\nThe twentieth century was marked by the appearance of prominent figures in African American literature. In this regard, Zora Neale Hurston was one of the most extraordinary and versatile persons concerned about acute racial issues in the United States. She was memorized due to her sympathy for Black workers and women who continuously experienced racial discrimination in the South. Thus, this paper aims at providing a summary of readings about Zora Hurston뗩 life, indicating her most outstanding works, central themes, and important moments of life.\\n\\nThe birth of Zora Hurston was slightly mysterious and obscure, and even its date was first established wrongly by the researchers of her biography. In particular, 랍cholars set the year of her birth as 1901, as in fact, she was born a decade earlier, on January 7, 1891 in Notasulga, Alabama (Zora Neale Hurston 997). When Hurston was a toddler, her family moved to Eatonville, Florida, her hometown that acquired a mythic image in her writings (ㄹbout Zora Neale Hurston). In Eatonville, Hurston뗩 family flourished, and her father even became one of the town뗩 mayors. Nevertheless, at that period, Hurston faced her first hardships, such as the death of her mother, clashes with her step-mother, and problems with studies. Despite all those events, Hurston 란arned her high school diploma from Morgan Academy in 1918, then studied sporadically at Howard University (Zora Neale Hurston 997). Hence, she obtained profound education, which was rare for Black women at that time.\\n\\nIn New York, in 1925, Zora Hurston revealed the talent of an artist and considerably contributed to the Harlem Renaissance. At Columbia, owing to the support of Franz Boas, a distinguished figure in anthropology, she was engrossed in examining black folklore and then published Mules and Men , the first collection of African American folktales. Hurston뗩 most outstanding works include Jonah뗩 Gourd Vine (1934), Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937), Moses, Man of the Mountain (1939), Seraph on the Suwanee (1948) (Norwood). For instance, her first novel 랃ad been well received both by the critics and the public (Zora Neale Hurston 998). The second work demonstrated the characters victory over limitations inflicted by poverty and discrimination. Overall, Zora Hurston continues to influences many writers throughout the world, forever having cemented her niche in history as an eminent writer of the twentieth century.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nㄹbout Zora Neale Hurston.

       " Document(page_content='Douglass Adams wrote a series of Sci-fi novels. The intelligent beings from all over the Universe would interact with each other. It would not have been realistic to have all those beings be able to speak the same language, so Adams created the Babel fish. The fish, when placed in the ear, translates the sounds from one being into the language of the hearing being. Because the chance of the Babel fish evolving naturally is about zero, and because god would never reveal himself by intentionally creating something that proves he exists, the Babel fish proves there is no god. (Or so Adams proposes.) Now go out and get a copy of the Hitchhiker\\'s Guide to the Galaxy and Don\\'t Panic.,\" \"Like you\\'re Five: The babel fish is an imaginary animal from a book. The author of the book likes to stop in the middle of things to tell funny stories that are only kind of related to what\\'s going on. When he introduced the babel fish, he told a story about a man who claimed it disproved the existence of God. The man\\'s reasoning was that the fish was so clearly the result of Intelligent Design that there was no question that God must exist. If there is complete certainty then there is no faith, and if there is no faith then there can be no God. God agreed with this and disappeared in a puff of logic. The man went on to prove that Black was White and White was Black and promptly got himself killed at the next Zebra crossing. This is just one of the funny bits in the book.

As you noticed, the country has just recently started converting to plastic bills. But you should note it\\'s no easy task. We started this last year and we\\'re only up to the twenties. The ten and five dollar bills are still to come next year. There\\'s a huge initial cost to switch from producing paper bills to producing plastic ones. You have to come up with a design, the anti-counterfeiting measures, and some way to make them (and make lots). So the difficulty of the conversion is the biggest factor; people want to make sure it\\'s really worth it. Nobody\\'s going to argue paper bills are better than plastic ones, but the question is \"is it worth the cost\"? Anyway, then there\\'s the smaller factors: the paper industry (and shrewd politicians who get a lot of money from the paper industry) doesn\\'t want such a change. That\\'s understandable; it\\'s how they make their money. Of course, at the same time, the plastics industry would serve to profit from such a change. Similarly, if you guys were to drop the dollar bill and adopt a dollar coin, the mining industry would benefit to the paper industry\\'s loss. That\\'s a rather minor factor that few people care about, but for politicians who are receiving big donations from these industries, they\\'ll fight to the teeth. So again, the biggest deterrent is the sheer difficulty of converting to plastic bills. After all, you got the design and costs of making the new bills, and then you have to figure out a plan to deal with the old bills and so on. Of course, there\\'s also some conservatives who refuse all means of change, including how their money feels (but as someone who\\'s been touching our new twenties all week, I can say the plastic bills are awesome!).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Prompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence. (250-500 words) My father\\'s mental illness has been a skeleton in the closet which I have kept from even my closest friends, as it is something I would rather push aside and keep hidden, but it has undoubtedly been the greatest influence in my determination for attending an excellent college. My mother and father met in college, where my father studied biochemistry and was still mentally \"healthy\". As my father\\'s research garnered attention, he was asked to study in several countries, and my mom came along with him. While studying in Canada, he was contacted by Harvard University and asked to come to Boston to do research, which is where I was born. Still in his early twenties, he moved on to lead a groundbreaking discovery at a biochemistry company, where his research was ultimately taken advantage of and stolen by an undeserving man who made hundreds of millions which my father did not receive a penny of. My mother tells me this is the point where my father\\'s mental health began to take a downward spiral. He would skimp on sleep while he did research, and made a drug himself that would allow him to stay awake for several days. After a few days, he ended up in the hospital, where he was then diagnosed with schizophrenia. This has caused him to be unemployed since and have unpredictable psychotic behaviors, such as hearing voices, talking to himself, or acting in an irrational manner. When I talk to my father, it is like he is not completely \"there.\" It feels as though I am speaking to the shadow of the old him, and I have witnessed his mental illness become progressively worse. Knowing that this man\\'s unique and brilliant mind was once in such high demand, is now destroyed and somewhat inept, has torn me apart at times, but also given me the greatest desire to utilize my intelligence. I feel as though it is almost my responsibility to achieve the success my father never got. My mother entered business in an effort to provide for us as a family. I have witnessed my mother work her way up in the business world, to now owning her own business, and this has been a great influence on my interest to major in business. Growing up with a literally psychotic father with unpredictable actions, a mother constantly working, and an older sister dealing with it all with alcoholism, was not the ideal family life. I used to deal with it with extreme worrying, sometimes wondering if I would inherit my dad\\'s psychosis. As I entered high school, I made a promise to myself to always strive for excellence and to get involved. By doing this, I grew out of my shyness and worrying habits and realized that I couldn\\'t change my family, but the greatest difference I could make would be utilizing my talents and intelligence to ultimately end up in a good college. I started my college searches years before my friends, knowing that it is the first step to a successful career, as well as my route to independence. I believe growing up with my father\\'s mental illness with knowledge of his past has instilled in me a unique self motivation which continues to grow.'),\n",

Although MARL has achieved considerable empirical success in solving real-world games, there is a lack of a self-contained overview in the literature that elaborates the game theoretical foundations of modern MARL methods and summarises the recent advances. In fact, the majority of existing surveys are outdated and do not fully cover the recent developments since 2010. In this work, we provide a monograph on MARL that covers both the fundamentals and the latest developments in the research frontier. Our work is separated into two parts. From to , we present the self-contained fundamental knowledge of MARL, including problem formulations, basic solutions, and existing challenges. Specifically, we present the MARL formulations through two representative frameworks, namely, stochastic games and extensive-form games, along with different variations of games that can be addressed. The goal of this part is to enable the readers, even those with minimal related background, to grasp the key ideas in MARL research. From to , we present an overview of recent developments of MARL algorithms. Starting from new taxonomies for MARL methods, we conduct a survey of previous survey papers. In later sections, we highlight several modern topics in MARL research, including Q-function factorisation, multi-agent soft learning, networked multi-agent MDP, stochastic potential games, zero-sum continuous games, online MDP, turn-based stochastic games, policy space response oracle, approximation methods in general-sum games, and mean-field type learning in games with infinite agents. Within each topic, we select both the most fundamental and cutting-edge algorithms. The goal of our monograph is to provide a self-contained assessment of the current state-of-the-art MARL techniques from a game theoretical perspective. We expect this work to serve as a stepping stone for both new researchers who are about to enter this fast-growing domain and existing domain experts who want to obtain a panoramic view and identify new directions based on recent advances.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The typical finding in modern medicine is Thimerosal (organic mercury) and several other harsh chemicals that cause neuronal damage and toxicity. On the other hand, herbal treatment is completely natural and has been tested for many years and shown to cause little if no bodily harm. Herbal treatment has also been becoming more widely available for people to use so almost all symptoms can be suppressed if one is using mere herbs to treat oneself. Similarly, acupuncture, which has been tested for over 3000 years, has been shown to actually deactivate the pain centers of the brain without using the placebo affect (as several studies have shown), while not causing any further neuronal toxicity compared to Pain Relievers. For these reasons, I support that natural, herbal treatment and acupuncture, once combined, is of much higher worth than the large majority of modern medicine (that is not herbal or acupunctural). EDIT: I am waiting for existing sources that break my arguments down. EDIT[1]: By modern medicine, I mean as in the areas of modern. Surgery is ancient, as far as we know, shown from ancient Chinese, Sumerian, and Egyptian texts. EDIT[2]: I do not see a point in this debate where any of us will change our minds. The main thing I am talking about is the untested side effects of modern medicine, in general, and their documented ingredients, which have been tested to cause occasional (and sometimes frequent) highly-problematic side effects. Since no one can prove that herbs, in general, and acupuncture, as it is, are worse than modern medicine, even when there is complete proof of the ingredients of these substances on government (United States) websites with experiments documenting their effects, I will stop responding to the responses. You are just attacking a form of Mercury which only one of the many controversial ingredients of these vaccines and drugs, while saying that it is documented \\'with the scientific method\\'. If one ingredient is tested that causes the intended effect works, there is no meaning of the rest of the ingredients being alright. Those ingredients are not tested or, more widely, tested and seen to cause a list of potential highly-negative side effects (mental deterioration, literal intoxication of the brain, hormonal imbalances, cancers, kidney problems, and much more).

My default happy hour choice on Ellsworth is Harris Grill, and so I guess for a long time I just overlooked 1947 completely. I've been here a couple of times within the past month and have had good experiences. The first was for late night drinks with a group of friends. Long picnic tables on the back patio easily accommodated our group of eight. I'm a fan of eating (and drinking) outside, so we were all about the patio. They also offer a couple of tables out on the sidewalk (probably some good people-watching here.... Ellsworth on a weekend night can be entertaining) and the main seating area inside of the restaurant is great as well. It's fairly dark and something about it just makes the place feel upscale and refined. As for drinks, we ordered a variety of featured cocktails from the menu and everyone enjoyed them. I started with a Rock and Rye, which is one of their happy hour specials during the week (rye whiskey, lemon, orange, pineapple, rosemary, and rock candy). I followed that up with a classic Manhattan. Both were excellent and the service was quick. On my most recent trip I ordered fish tacos (apps are 12 off during happy hour). I was fairly disappointed in these. There just wasn't anything special about them and to me they were bland. Salsa or anything with a little bit of a kick would have gone a long way to help these. My friends ordered a variety of other apps and everything else seemed fine. Apparently their mac and cheese is amazing, so maybe next time I'll go that route. Overall it's a nice place to get drinks with friends. Service has been great each time and I'm glad to have another reliable happy hour spot in Shadyside!\"),\n",

College is a time for new and exciting experiences as well as a time to explore diverse and innovative ideas. If given the opportunity to attend BU, I would love to explore the field of research as well as further develop my love for the Spanish language and culture by studying abroad. As a nationally and internationally renowned research institution, Boston University offers an impressive number and range of opportunities for undergrads. While studying the website, I came across DROP, a program in which I would definitely participate if given the chance to attend BU. I feel that this program would be an outstanding learning experience, helping to build confidence and knowledge in one\\'s particular field of study. Although there is a broad range of fields, a specific few caught my eye, including psychology, neuroscience, and pediatrics, but above all-cancer research. These days, almost everyone knows someone who is fighting this disease or has passed away from it, and with the unsettling fact that about half of all men and one third of all women in the United States will get cancer at some point in their lives, it has been my lifelong dream to help find a cure. With such a groundbreaking research university as BU, this dream can become a reality to aid cancer patients worldwide. With students from all over the nation and world, Boston University is quite the melting pot of cultures, yet there is just one more way I plan to broaden my horizons as an undergrad-study abroad. Ever since my first Spanish class in the seventh grade, I have developed an undeniable love for the language and culture of Spain. I am currently in Spanish five at my high school, and although we learn about Madrid, Barcelona, Toledo, and other cities, I do not believe you can fully grasp their cultures without experiencing it firsthand. Specifically, I want to study in Madrid, and with BU\\'s International Programs, not only would I be able to study there, but possibly have an internship as well. While living in a foreign country, I hope to experience a whole different way of thinking and being and living, so that I can return home with a new understanding of the world and my place in it.

Everyone has one or wants one or the newest latest one .Ever since they were invented in 1700s people have taken the full advantage of the telephone presidents and war sargents used them to win battles and etc. Now the phone has evolved from tube looking phones to brick phones to flip phones to iphones and to smartphones. With all the new technology and apps like facetime snapchat3 games music social media there's almost no way anyone could ever put their phones down. But according to statistics in 2013 about 3,154 people died in accidents 424,000 were injured. In 2013, 10% of all drivers ages 15 to 19 involved in fatal accidents were reported to be distracted at the time of the crash.\\n\\nSo the question stands do we need to drive while on your cellphone? With all the crashes maybe we should drive without our phones but with the increments in technology we mind as well just use them cars are able to call people just like phones, so if you can call people in your car and be distracted anyways when your calling whom ever. There putting almost smartphones in the car so you can most defiantly be distracted with that. The fact that they are and already are making cars able to drive by themselves is anther reason that is very distracting just as in Tulsa the electrically powered car has pilot mode so it drives itself. So many people have been distracted from the road and driving because the car can drive itself even though the car can drive itself you still need to pay attention to the road.\\n\\nI do understand that you don't need to be looking down when driving and I do understand that phones are distracting. So you picking up a cellphone and calling someone can be distracting. Also like I said in another essay I did there is a responsibility factor to firstly own a car and secondly to even own a phone. It might seem like it is not a responsibility owning a phone but it is when you own a phone you have personal information in it. If you were lose your phone and have never put a password or security code on it you can lose your information to whoever has your phone could be a hacker could be a random thieve.\\n\\nSo really my answer is that it really depends on your responsibility level if you can't stay off your phone and it's life then you need to let someone drive but if you can be responsible while driving then I'd say you should us your phone responsibly.

       " Document(page_content='Large-scale retrieval systems are often implemented as a cascading sequence of phases - a first filtering step, in which a large set of candidate documents are extracted using a simple technique such as Boolean matching andor static document scores; and then one or more ranking steps, in which the pool of documents retrieved by the filter is scored more precisely using dozens or perhaps hundreds of different features. The documents returned to the user are then taken from the head of the final ranked list. Here we examine methods for measuring the quality of filtering and preliminary ranking stages, and show how to use these measurements to tune the overall performance of the system. Standard top-weighted metrics used for overall system evaluation are not appropriate for assessing filtering stages, since the output is a set of documents, rather than an ordered sequence of documents. Instead, we use an approach in which a quality score is computed based on the discrepancy between filtered and full evaluation. Unlike previous approaches, our methods do not require relevance judgments, and thus can be used with virtually any query set. We show that this quality score directly correlates with actual differences in measured effectiveness when relevance judgments are available. Since the quality score does not require relevance judgments, it can be used to identify queries that perform particularly poorly for a given filter. Using these methods, we explore a wide range of filtering options using thousands of queries, categorize the relative merits of the different approaches, and identify useful parameter combinations.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Navigating the System For Families Experiencing Homelessness Essay\\n\\nHomelessness is a person뗩 social status due to the lack of any housing designed and suitable for living. As a social phenomenon, it is caused by a complex of social, economic, civil, and cultural conflicts, as a result of which a part of the population is deprived of living conditions, which are recognized as an integral part of civilized society and social policy in modern states.\\n\\nThe problem of existence and increase in the quantity of the homeless population in recent years has become extremely acute. Today, there are about 150 million homeless people in the world, which is 2 percent of the world뗩 population (Thompson 254). The following reasons for the appearance of this category of people can be identified: alcoholism, drug addiction, loss of housing as a result of apartment fraud, lack of a permanent job and, as a consequence, inability to maintain housing, loss of living space due to imprisonment, conflicts in the family, and serious illnesses. The increase in homelessness in recent years has been the result of a systemic socio-political and economic crisis as well.\\n\\nThis category of people needs assistance, which can be provided in the form of cash benefits, necessities, temporary accommodation, free meals, social housing, assistance in social rehabilitation, as well as medical and social counseling (Thompson 257). It is necessary to carry out targeted measures for the social adaptation of the homeless by both governmental and non-governmental bodies.\\n\\nI can help homeless people with their basic needs by providing food, drink, and clothes. If I meet a homeless near my house, in the basement, or the attic, I will not chase that person out into the street. I will give that individual warm clothes, food, and check if he or she needs any medical assistance. If there are warming centers or shelters in the city, I will tell the person that he or she may spend the night there, or give a leaflet with addresses. If a person has a request for restoration of documents, employment, search for relatives, then I will tell him or her about social assistance.\\n\\nHomeless people face many difficulties: they do not have drinking water and food, including hot water, which helps not to freeze. It is especially difficult for them in the cold season, so they need particular help and special attention in winter. Like any other person, I can buy a homeless person some warm food and a glass of hot tea, which does not cause any trouble for me. Besides, I can also help any charity and non-governmental organization nearby that cares for homeless people. In such a way, volunteering just a bit of my time, I may save someone뗩 life.\\n\\nWork Cited\\n\\nThompson, Erika L., et al.

Would this benefit us or would it not? Some cities and countries around the world are banning cars. Instead they would like to use public transportation, a biciylce, or maybe your own two feet to get around. I believe that this topic is reasonable and I agree.\\n\\nThe United States is considering this law of not having to use our cars for a day or two each week so we can get out in the fresh air or try out some new transportation for personal knowledge of more ways to get around. The paper, The End of Car Culture, states that \"recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.\" Assuming, we are already shifting into a lifestyle of not having a car for a day or two. To me, this would benefit the country because of our high obesity rate. If more people ride their bikes to places or walk places, this will give them more exercise opportunities and help them lose weight in a more constructive way. Just riding your bike or walking a mile to the grocery store a day can definitely help someone out.\\n\\nSpeaking of helping things out, how about the environment? The article, Paris band driving due to smog, states that \"After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.\" Robert Duffer also states that Paris uses Mondays to be deicated ro even-numbered license plates are ordered to leave their cars at home and the next day odd-numbered license plates were ordered to keep their cars home. The diesel fuel in Paris was hurting the environment so that is why they banned cars. Here in the United States I believe that the car pollution is also hurting our environment. Riding bikes and walking places is a good activity for everyone to do.\\n\\nMost of us, except the 2% of people in America, have trouble with money. Riding bikes around and walking to a friends house or to the store, would definitely help our money situations. Not having a car two days a week means we do not have to get gas as much, which would save us money. Using a taxi would be useful too but, not as much becuase the money adds up also. Not using cars can completely help our community and country in so many ways.\\n\\nBanning cars for a day or two sounds like a fantastic idea.

I would imagine giving students summer projects to be a pain for them, since many students are taking a long break away from school and have probably made plans to do things with their family and friends, but if they were to be given projects that can come up with on their own, students would continue to learn about the lessons that their teachers had given them, the project alone would increase their creativity, and school counties will be able to see how much information they have taken in over the entire school year.\\n\\nAlthough students coming up with their own assignments to do for the summer project would increase their learning abilities, have trouble thinking of their own project and how they're going to make it. Not only that but teachers assigning the project to their students would be a bit easier than students having to look up a topic and figure out what to do on their own. I know that sometimes having to figure out what you are going to figure can be a bit challenging, especially if you dont know what the topic of the project is, but having a teacher assign the project to you would be less frustrating because they can tell you what you do and do not have to do or what you need before you leave for summer break.\\n\\nStudents being given assignments by teacher would also be a terrible option due to the fact that said student would not be able to be as creative as he/she wants to and they would not be able to do the topic that they wanted to do. For example, a teacher talks about the summer-project and he/she would assign them to do the project on something history related. It wouldnt exactly be fair to any of the other students in the classroom who dont want to do the topic in what their teacher gave them. Having to do the project alone during their break would already be a pain, but i think if the student had created something related to what they wanted to do, then it could make them more inspired, and motivated instead of giving them something that theyre not even interested in, which is exactly why i think student-designed summer projects would be the better option.\"),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Causes of the American Revolution: Proclamation & Declaration Acts Essay\\n\\nThe American Revolution is the event that resulted in the United States gaining independence and ceasing to be part of the British colonies. The term bourgeois revolution is often used to evaluate this rebellion, as the violent action captured all parties involved in the conflict. In addition, the revolution was the result of several factors, including the Royal Proclamation of 1763 and The Declaratory Act.\\n\\nThe Proclamation Act of 1763 sought to settle new British lands in North America and stabilize relations with the Indians by regulating the fur trade, colonization, and land purchases on the western frontier. In addition, the goals were also the assimilation of the French population and the transformation of Canada into a British colony. The Proclamation was initially well-received among the American colonists because of the emancipation of the land and the cessation of hostilities (Ellis, 2021). However, there was a backlash among the migrating colonists in which many ignored the Proclamation and settled in the west, creating tension between them and the Native Americans. The Proclamation is believed to have regulated land relations for the first time, but recognizing Native sovereignty remains unresolved. Nevertheless, the Proclamation Act remains an important influence on Native representations and movements, including American colonist migrations and land consolidation.\\n\\nThe purpose of The Declaratory Act was to equalize the powers of Parliament in America with Great Britain. The Declaratory Act of 1766 was about the absolute power of the Parliament to legislate and amend the colonial government, even though the colonists were not members of Parliament (Ellis, 2021). In so doing, the Act denied freedom and tightened the framework within which colonists could act. The Act vividly demonstrates the British government뗩 unpreparedness for the political fullness and awareness that arose among Americans. In so doing, the Act exacerbated the psychological aspect of the colonists and spurred Americans to act for their freedom.\\n\\nThus, among the events preceding the American Revolution, a considerable number of acts hurt American society. The gradual accumulation of pressures and the aggravated situation of indigenous peoples led to the emergence of protests and the strengthening of political literacy. The American Revolution resulted from extensive changes in social attitudes, also affecting legal norms and introducing notions of freedom struggles.\\n\\nReference\\n\\nEllis, J. J. (2021).

These suburban communities have used every other way of transpotation except cars, taxis, buses, and some even trains; they pretty much use anything that doesn\\'t have an engine. Many citizen like not have to drive everywhere. In Source 1, paragraph 3, \"\"When I had a car I was always tense.

In Source 2, paragraph 5, \"Congestion has down 60% in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog.\" The lower rates of traffic congestion helped a significant amount of French citizens to get to where they were going faster and less accident on the road.\\n\\nOther countries have created a somewhat holiday called car-free day where millions of people hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during that day. The only vehicles on the road were buses and taxis. In Source 3, paragraph 7, \"These people are generating a revolutionary changeand this crossing the borders.\" The citizens doing this are very open to this change and enthusiastic about it. It also helped cities renovate and rebuild themselves. In Source 3, parargraph 9, \"Parks and sports centers have throughout the city; uneven and pitted sidewalks have been replaced by brad, smooth sidewalks.\" These change that this holiday has influenced helped the cities to become a safe place.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the limits of car usage has helped bring great beneficial change to many countries of the world.

Today I would like to tell you about my father, who has always played a pivotal role in my family.  \\n  \\nMy father is a farmer, and he has the dark skin and muscular body that farmers usually have. Despite being over 50, the age at which a farmer should retire, Dad continues to work every day, taking care of the Durian garden, ensuring that my family has food to eat, clothes to wear, and my sisters and I will have a better future. My father is important in my family; he always does his best for us. Every time I called or spoke with him, he constantly urged, \"You should eat more, and you should drive carefully.\" Being an introvert himself, my Dad does not reveal his emotions like other fathers, but I know he constantly concerns and worries about me. Whenever he does something, he devotes his entire focus to it until it finishes. He will not easily give up against adversity. I once witnessed him try to fix the machine, but by looking around, I could tell it was too old to operate again, but my father doesn\\'t see it that way; he spent hours fixing it, step by step, and at the end of the day, It worked again.

       " Document(page_content='We study the problem of testing identity against a given distribution with a focus on the high confidence regime. More precisely, given samples from an unknown distribution p over n elements, an explicitly given distribution q, and parameters 0 e, d 1, we wish to distinguish, with probability at least - 1 d, whether the distributions are identical versus e -far in total variation distance. Most prior work focused on the case that d O (1), for which the sample complexity of identity testing is known to be Th (n e 2). Given such an algorithm, one can achieve arbitrarily small values of d via black-box amplification, which multiplies the required number of samples by Th (log (1 d. We show that black-box amplification is suboptimal for any d o (1), and give a new identity tester that achieves the optimal sample complexity. Our new upper and lower bounds show that the optimal sample complexity of identity testing is Th (1 e 2 (n log (1 d) log (1 d for any n, e, and d. For the special case of uniformity testing, where the given distribution is the uniform distribution U n over the domain, our new tester is surprisingly simple: to test whether p U n versus d T V (p, U n) e, we simply threshold d T V (p, U n), where p is the empirical probability distribution. The fact that this simple \"plug-in\" estimator is sample-optimal is surprising, even in the constant d case. Indeed, it was believed that such a tester would not attain sublinear sample complexity even for constant values of e and d. An important contribution of this work lies in the analysis techniques that we introduce in this context. First, we exploit an underlying strong convexity property to bound from below the expectation gap in the completeness and soundness cases. Second, we give a new, fast method for obtaining provably correct empirical estimates of the true worst-case failure probability for a broad class of uniformity testing statistics over all possible input distributions - including all previously studied statistics for this problem. We believe that our novel analysis techniques will be useful for other distribution testing problems as well.'),\n",

I don't know why, but I have always got a feeling in my inner about what was going on around me, so when I got older I was quiet concern that I wanted to study International Relations. I see it as the right way to develop myself as a person and what is more to get the right knowledge to be able to help this society we are living in. Furthermore, I am a kind of person who believes in human beings and that we all together can change things in a better way. To tell you the truth I was looking for quiet a few universities in my country, Spain. All of them were quite good but when I came across AUC I got the feeling that this one would suit everything I was looking for. Why? First, studying in the AUC allows me to get better with my English and the same time it unable(allows me) to learn Arabic language and living a culture and a way of living different from my country. I think that learning a language is learning a culture, and everything together will help me to get to know both, American and Arabic society. In a few words the AUC has something that the others lack of, and what is it? The AUC gets together two different cultures in the same place. Another fact that helps me to choose the American university was the musical program. I am really fascinated by it. I couldn't believe it because it will allow me to keep on playing my violin. Furthermore, I have been playing it since I was a child and I wouldn't like to give it up. That was what makes my mind up, so here I am. You may be wondering why I have come to Cairo to study. I have always been interested into Arabic world, owing that my father is Lebanese and I would like to understand their way of living and thinking and being here living with them, I would be able to get to know them much better. I am fairly sure that the AUC is the right place to help me to grow and provides me a great knowledge, not only Arabian world but also western one. Last but not least, the AUC is a fantastic university for many reasons. I will be able to give the best of myself and to achieve my goals, living in Egypt, an amazing country and learning in the American way, which is known to be one of teethe best in the field of the International Relations. It would be an honor for me to be a part of such a great and international renowned university.\"),\n",

But then you go home after school and you feel bored and you feel like you aren't doing good in school and you need extra help. If this is you? Then keep reading! Extracurricular activities are things that students can choose to do. Whether it be sports, art, music or even extra help on something. I agree that all students should participate in extracurricular activities because you'll get better grades, you'll be more busy and productive, and you'll have better relationships with friends.\\n\\nThe first reason I want to talk about is that you'll get better grades. Kids go to school to learn but sometimes they learn something that they don't fully understand. Then their grades start dropping and suddenly then aren't doing too good. But if you stay in extracurricular activities, you'll get extra help with things you don't understand and in return, you'll get all A's. Even with something like sports or music. They both help you get smarter and help you be more productive which leads to doing good in school.\\n\\nMy second reason is that being in extracurricular activities helps you be more busy and productive. being in extracurricular activities helps a lot with being productive. Mostly, when you are at home, you aren't doing anything productive. Your just being on your phone or playing video gomes. But with staying after school, you'll make better use of your time which helps you to not only waste your time, but also helps you to do good in school.\\n\\nNow, my third and final reason is that you'll have a better relationship with friends. Now, one of the main reasons why kids stay after school is obviously to see their friends. And thats actually a really good reason as to why students should stay after school. you'd have better relationships with your friends and even make new friends if you stayed after. you'd be able to see your friends more and spend more time with them.\\n\\nSo to wrap things up, I agree that all students should participate in extracurricular activities after school. Getting good grades, being more productive, and having better relationships with friends are hopefully all good reasons that make you want to stay after the final bell. So after reading all the way through. Did this change your mind?\"),\n",

Do you believe that the projects should be teacher-designed or students-designed? In my opinion, I believe the summer projects should be teacher-designed. In my paper, I will explain why I believe so.\\n\\nOne of the reasons why I believe summer projects should be teacher-designed is because teachers would know what to include into the summer projects. They know what information to give, and what they've been learning. Teachers also know how to put different information in a way students can learn material easier. Also, teachers can include new information to get them ready for the next year.\\n\\nAdditionally, teacher-designed projects could also prevent cheating. If students had a chance to design a project, they would most likely make the project to where they don't have to do any work. Or they use material they've already learned, which means they're not learning anything by doing the projects. Teachers can also make different projects for each student, so their could be no copying another student's paper.\\n\\nFurthermore, I believe summer projects should be teacher-designed is because teachers design all the work during school, so they should continue to do so. And that is because students never design any work during the school year, so they probably would not know how to design a project. Some may forget important imformation and details, which can effect learning. Teachers know the best to get students to learn new information and materials.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I believe teachers should design the summer projects for students. I believe so because they know what to include in the project. Additionally, they can prevent cheating. And furthermore, they design school work all year, so they should continue to do so.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Workplace Relations and Equality Policymaking Coursework\\n\\nThere are different laws governing the relationship between employers and their employees. It is agreeable that many employees have expressed their concerns due to the increasing cases of inequality, discrimination, and abuse in the workplace. It has always been the duty of organizational leaders to address the issues affecting every employee in his or her working environment. Leadership is a critical practice that encourages managers to show 랎otal commitment, address problems at the place of work, and guide their employees. The problem of inequality and discrimination at the workplace continues to affect many employees and workplaces. Policymakers and organizational leaders should reexamine this problem and come up with the best incentives to deal with it.\\n\\nIt is the employer뗩 duty to treat his or her employees equally, fairly, and without prejudice. Employers should have proper guidelines and laws determining the relationship between their organizations and employees. Today there are many employees complaining because their organizations do not protect them from different forms of workplace abuse and discrimination. For example, most of the minority groups such as women and disabled persons continue to face challenges in their places of work. This is a real life issue because it continues to affect many organizations today. For instance, there are different forms of discrimination in my organization thus making it hard to realize most of the targeted goals and objectives. This problem calls for new strategies and ideas in order to make every organization profitable and successful. A satisfied employee will always be productive. The employee will always support the needs of his or her workmates.\\n\\nThat being the case, managers should use different leadership concepts and theories in order to deal with this issue. The first leadership approach is the use of relationship theories. These theories of leadership are necessary because they focus on the relationship existing between leaders and their employees in an organization. According to these theories, leaders should inspire and motivate their employee. The approach will help them establish new teams and treat each other fairly. These theories of leadership encourage managers to promote the best moral standards and ethical practices. This leadership theory is necessary because it helps leaders and managers promote the best relationships at the workplace. The approach will significantly reduce instances of discrimination and abuse. Organizations and government agencies should embrace this theory in order to have a 랎ransformation.\\n\\nContingency theories are also useful towards addressing this problem. According to the theories, leaders can examine the existing situations at the workplace and use the best managerial concepts. Leaders motivate and influence their employees in order to achieve a specific goal. It is the duty of leaders to examine every situation accurately and use the best ideas or concepts. This will help them achieve the targeted goals. Whenever there is discrimination or abuse in the workplace, the theory encourages leaders to address the situation accordingly.\\n\\nThese leadership approaches can address most of the challenges affecting many employees today. Leadership is a powerful tool because it brings individuals together by addressing their differences. The strategy makes it impossible to achieve a common goal. New policies are necessary towards making employers responsible for the welfare of their employees. A satisfied employee will always work hard in order to achieve the organization뗩 goals. In conclusion, the above strategy will address this real life issue.\\n'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Case Involving Confidentiality and Electronic Charting Essay\\n\\nThe case must healthcare organizations in the country use electronic health records (EHR) following the enforcement of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). ARRA requires all healthcare organizations to have EHR by the year 2015. Unlike electronic medical records (which only allows a provider to access medical records), electronic health records can be accessed by an authorized healthcare network. This makes EHR more convenient and faster to access a patient뗩 data in real-time. EHR also makes it possible to easily detect any inappropriate viewing of a patient뗩 information.\\n\\nHowever, as with all network platforms, security concerns of breach of the system exist. The possibility of cyber-attack or system hacks could lead to identity theft which can destroy a person뗩 finances and reputation. If the breach occurs to multiple patients, then the case will surely be headed down the road of legal battles and court tribulations. Surprisingly, the biggest threat to EHR has not been hackers trying to steal healthcare data. Ray & Mackay (2015) shows that the biggest risk has been irresponsible or unethical healthcare employees who access the patients confidential information inappropriately.\\n\\nAnd such was the case in a California hospital early this year (January 2015). The case involved a pharmacist employee who was discovered to have been snooping on a patient뗩 medical data for nearly a year. The hospital pharmacist whose employment was terminated thereof had snooped every bit of confidential information including clinical notes, diagnoses, medical prescription, and demographics. The hospital뗩 EHR audit discovered that 844 patients information had been inappropriately accessed and14 of them had had their PHI compromised. This is a privacy and security breach as provided by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA), which requires health providers to protect the privacy and interests of the patients.\\n\\nThis incident at California Pacific Medical center is one of the many cases that continue to be exposed as EHR audits are conducted.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nRay, E., & Mackay, H.

       " Document(page_content=\"Today's Internet has witnessed an increase in the popularity of mobile video streaming, which is expected to exceed 3 4 of the global mobile data traffic by 2019. To satisfy the considerable amount of mobile video requests, video service providers have been pushing their content delivery infrastructure to edge networks-from regional CDN servers to peer CDN servers (e.g., smartrouters in users' homes) -to cache content and serve users with storage and network resources nearby. Among the edge network content caching paradigms, Wi-Fi access point caching and cellular base station caching have become two mainstream solutions. Thus, understanding the effectiveness and performance of these solutions for large-scale mobile video delivery is important. However, the characteristics and request patterns of mobile video streaming are unclear in practical wireless network. In this paper, we use real-world datasets containing 50 million trace items of nearly 2 million users viewing more than 0.3 million unique videos using mobile devices in a metropolis in China over 2 weeks, not only to understand the request patterns and user behaviors in mobile video streaming, but also to evaluate the effectiveness of Wi-Fi and cellular-based edge content caching solutions. To understand performance of edge content caching for mobile video streaming, we first present temporal and spatial video request patterns, and we analyze their impacts on caching performance using frequency-domain and entropy analysis approaches. We then study the behaviors of mobile video users, including their mobility and geographical migration behaviors, which determine the request patterns. Using trace-driven experiments, we compare strategies for edge content caching including LRU and LFU, in terms of supporting mobile video requests. We reveal that content, location and mobility factors all affect edge content caching performance. Moreover, we design an efficient caching strategy based on the measurement insights and experimentally evaluate its performance. The results show that our design significantly improves the cache hit rate by up to 30 compared with LRULFU.\"),\n",

This technology will help in schools, working environments and more, people will be able to tell if someone is feeling upset, depressed, happy, bored or content.\\n\\nIn relation to Mona Lisa, the article explains that she is \"83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry.\" This shows that the computer is advanced enough to identify emotions of a woman from many centries ago. Due to the study of human anatomy the computer is able classify emotions like \"happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness.\" With normal identification skills if there was a mix of them people could tell exactly how others felt. For instance if someone got 68% sadness, 22% angry and 10% fear, then people could tell that the person needed help, or was not fine like they said they were. If computers with this technology were in schools teachers would be able to tell if there student were okay. Most students say there okay but with this technology we would be able to perceive if people need help or theorpy.

       " Document(page_content=\"Little disclaimer: this deals with US laws and procedures so I apologize if anyone outside the US isn't able to contribute, except to tell me how great it is having this in their own country. Last Sunday John Oliver's show dealt with this subject and chastised the US for being only one of two developed countries in the world without maternity leave that is paid for by the taxpayers. Here is a link to watch it if you haven't seen it yet: Here is the gist of my viewpoint: In the US, when a person is terminated from a job, heshe is entitled to unemployment benefits for up to 99 weeks or until they are employed again. Workers and companies pay into this and, while many people end up taking more than they give, it is the system we have and it seems to work for the majority of people here. When a person leaves a job VOLUNTARILY, however, they are not entitled to unemployment benefits. If you quit a job to go to another job this is fine. If you are quitting to go'find' yourself in Australia for a year, you better have a financial plan because you can't live off other peoples' money for your vacation. This system also seems to work well for most people. In the US, abortion is Constitutionally protected under a person's right to privacy. The details of the laws vary from state to state but there is no place in the US where a person cannot legally and safely obtain an abortion during the first six months of pregnancy. My stance is that if having a child is a choice, it should be one the parents must prepare for financially before making - just like if they wanted to voluntarily take time off work for other reasons. We have safety nets for people who are caught in situations they can't control. This is not one of them. Being a parent requires the ability to plan and budget anyway, and it includes many expenses that people will absolutely incur that will not be covered by the hard work of others. It should start with planning to be off work for whatever time having the baby takes. I completely support peoples' positions being protected while they are off and, quite honestly, think that length of time should be extended from 12 weeks to 24 weeks. But I REALLY don't like the idea of taxpayer dollars being used to support ANYONE who voluntarily leaves work - no matter the reason. Change My View. EDIT: I am also against he government mandating that companies provide paid maternity leave on simple Constitutional grounds. In the US the Constitution prohibits the government from mandating this. But I would LOVE it if companies started doing it voluntarily and think it would be a huge positive for attracting top talent. But it should be between employers and employees to figure out compensation packages. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

       " Document(page_content='American History: Foreign in a Domestic Sense Essay\\n\\nThe emergence of the US as a nation did not follow a trajectory comparable to other nations. The country came into existence as an amalgam of different states composed of European immigrants looking for new opportunities. While the founders of the nation managed to create a democratic state, the country뗩 political thinking was not free from the social and economic constructs prevalent in the world of the time.\\n\\nThe fundamental drive of the immigrants who came to the US was to escape the excesses of the imperial regimes governing Europe. However, the US still became a slave nation. After the official abolishment of slavery, the country systematically adopted policies that institutionalized racial segregation that led to the emergence of the civil rights movement.\\n\\nThis shows that while the country sought to define itself as a land of equal opportunity, the US still perpetuated some of the prevailing practices of imperialistic administrations in the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Italy, and Germany, which limited the opportunities available to some inhabitants.\\n\\nWhen Justice Edward Douglas White arrived at the conclusion that Puerto Rico as a territory was 랁oreign in a domestic sense, he was trying to find a viable description of Puerto Rico that was consistent with America뗩 image as a republic (Kaplan 2). This description highlights two important aspects of the self-image of the US in the context of imperialism and international politics.\\n\\nFirst, it communicates a sense of ambiguity of the status of the US as a republic (Kaplan 3). During its inception, the US was essentially an amalgam of willing states that created a confederation. In this regard, each state had an equal opportunity to consider its options and to determine its future. The process was very complex and in some cases, it took battles to settle issues.\\n\\nThe question of how to handle territories outside the US that the federal government controlled and territories outside the control of the US that wanted to become part of the US arose. After the US took its current form, some territories such as the Philippines chose to fight the US for independence. Others like Puerto Rico and Hawaii chose to join the US.\\n\\nHowever, Puerto Rico found itself at a disadvantage because it had to deal with an established federal system. If Puerto Rico was among the states that participated in the creation of the US, it might have been easier for it to become part of the republic.\\n\\nThis shows that the US still views itself as an empire in the light of the territories it controls outside of its domestic borders. In this sense, Puerto Rico is the property, but not a part of the US (Kaplan 4). On the other hand, the US also views itself as a republic. This view underlies its resistance to Puerto Rico뗩 efforts to become a full US state.\\n\\nThe second aspect of the self-identity of the US portrayed by the phrase, 랁oreign in a domestic sense is the contradiction between its values and its practices. The US has always viewed itself as a bastion of democracy and as a defender of constitutional rule and human rights.\\n\\nHowever, the US treatment of Puerto Rico shows that the country has not fully reconciled its desire to promote the full expression of human rights with its need to defend its national identity. US Jurisprudence on Puerto Rico makes it extremely difficult for Puerto Rico to become a US state, or to evolve into a sovereign state.\\n\\nCurrent court rulings and some US laws mean that inhabitants of Puerto Rico cannot vote in a US presidential election and Puerto Rico뗩 representative in US Congress cannot vote in the house. These policies deny the people of Puerto Rico the right to self-determination.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nKaplan, Amy. The Anarchy of Empire in the Making of US Culture .

       " Document(page_content=\"I believe that drivers should not use their phones while driving. The reason behind this is that Mobile phone use while driving is common, but it is widely considered dangerous due to its potential for causing distracted driving and crashes. Due to the number of crashes that are related to conducting calls on a phone and texting while driving, some jurisdictions have made the use of calling on a phone while driving illegal. Many jurisdictions have enacted laws to ban handheld mobile phone use. In some cases restrictions are directed at minors, those who are newly qualified license holders (of any age), or to drivers in school zones.\\n\\nIn addition to voice calling, activities such as texting while driving, web browsing, playing video games, or phone use in general can also increase the risk of a crash. In the United States, automobile crashes due to distracted driving are increasing. The leading cause of distracted driving is cell phones. In 2017, 3,166 people were killed by distracted driving. Cell phone use while driving has become a leading cause of vehicle crashes over the last two decades. Using a cell phone while driving increases the driver's risk of causing a crash.\\n\\nDrivers are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more car crashes. When drivers talk on cell phones the risk of an automobile crash resulting in hospitalization is four times higher than when not talking on a cell phone. Drivers who text while behind the wheel, are twenty-three times more likely to have an automobile crash. One out of every four automobile crashes in the United States are caused by texting while driving. Some states have implemented laws in regards to using cell phones while driving, there is more to be done.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I believe that driving while using your mobile device should not be allowed. It is a distraction that can cause the driver and innocent bystanders to lose their lives over something that can easily be prevented.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nSnyder, Edgar (2017).

I am living in France, outer space, Washington and New York City. I can be anywhere and everywhere in an instant. It isn't magic or make-believe. It is my life. I've learned to live in two places at once by simply, picking up a book. Easy. To some people they're just bits of paper glued to a fragile spine. But to me, each book holds a world of its own. They're filled with stories and adventures, waiting for me to open them, to delve into these lives and become the character. Reading is my passion. Having a perfect book in my hands is like heaven. Everywhere I go, I make sure I have one with me. Physically I may be on a bus or train but mentally, I'm a werewolf in the woods, painfully transforming into a beast. As my collection grows, I gain knowledge. Through this knowledge I am able to see the world, my world differently. I go through piles and piles of books every year. I just love reading the words, devouring the story, escaping my reality. Because At that moment, when my eyes are moving from left to right; and my hand, almost robotically, flipping one page after another; I am transported to a new place. These novels take me on adventures. They lead me through the wild; they lead me through a jungle. They take me by a sleeping dragon, and its pile of gold. Furthermore, they take me far from here, they help me get away. Furthermore, they take me into worlds of magic, lands filled with terror. Land filled with wonders. Once I close the book, and I'm back in my reality, it's a bittersweet moment. It's when I realize that I am not a princess or a vampire. It's when I look up and see that everyone around me is just carrying around with their lives, oblivious to the fact that I have just experienced emotional trauma at the hands of a paperback. Furthermore, it's amazing how lost I can get with just a book in my hands. How easy it is to disregard the world around me. And for a few hours, I forget that I'm just me.

       " Document(page_content='Analysis of the Differences Between Laws and Ethics Essay\\n\\nEthics refers to a set of rules or guiding principles that inform and govern people뗩 conduct in various situations and circumstances. For example, different professions have different codes of ethics that determine how they behave and act. Ethics influence behavior and decisions in various ways. In addition, it can be classified into different groups including personal ethics, professional ethics, and universal ethics that govern society.\\n\\nOn the other hand, law refers to rules or codes of practice that are created and reinforced by an authority such as a government in order to bring order and cohesion. Law is compelling because failure to adhere to its precepts leads to punishment. Moreover, law is diverse because its implementation includes various forms including constitutions, policies, terms of service, and other forms of legal provisions.\\n\\nLaw and ethics have several similarities. First, they influence human conduct and decisions in order to benefit individuals and society. People follow ethics because it represents principles and values that direct society. On the other hand, people follow law because it creates a common ground to unify people and create order among individuals in society.\\n\\nSecond, they serve the main aim in society. They improve the moral status of individuals in society. Law enforces certain rules with a punishment threat if broken. Ethics relies on people뗩 rationality and sensibilities in order to influence people뗩 behaviors. They are both responsible for maintenance of order and social cohesion.\\n\\nLaw and ethics have several differences. Law is compelling while ethics is not. Breaking law results in punishment while acting without regard to ethics does not have punishment. Acting ethically is a personal responsibility while obeying law is mandatory for everyone. Again, they influence people뗩 conduct in different ways.\\n\\nEthics usually affects people뗩 behavior with regard to how they treat those who are close to them or those whom they interact with regularly. In contrast, law affects people뗩 behavior with regard to people whom they rarely interact with. Ethics is defined by the values, customs, or beliefs of a community or society.\\n\\nIn contrast, law is defined by universally accepted standards and behaviors. Ethics is immune to societal or communal change while law is not immune to change. Ethics changes only when the morals, perceptions, and values of society change. On the contrary, law can be changed by an act of a governing body or a decision by lawmakers.\\n\\nEthics tells people what they ought to do and in what ways. For example, business people are expected to serve their customers with honesty and fairness. This concept does not apply to law because it tells people what they are not supposed to do and what they must do. It has prohibitions and mandates. Unlike ethics, it does not tell people what they should do and in what ways. Finally, ethics influences individuals internally while law influences people externally. While law is enforced, ethics is not.\\n\\nIn conclusion, law and ethics are similar because they aim to promote order and cohesion in society. In addition, they influence behavior in ways that benefit individuals and society. On the other hand, they are different in several ways. Law is enforced while ethics is not. Law is easily changed while ethics is immune to changes.\\n\\nChanges depend on shifts in people뗩 moral values and cultures. Finally, law is binding because it tells people what they cannot do and what they must do. Ethics tells people what they ought to do. People are free to either adhere to ethics or not. On the contrary, it is mandatory to follow law.\\n'),\n",

       " Document(page_content='The clock struck eleven, and I glanced over my shoulder. The shuffling boots stop in unison with my own steps. I turned around and glared at them. Across the bridge stood a crowd of eighty, no ninety, so people. Standing silently, they were all readily equipped with pipes, and fancy horn-rimmed spectacles that curled around the edges. All adorned in formal clothes ranging from kahki slacks, to gowns that hoisted up around the hips. Time travelers. For some God-forsaken reason, in the future archaic forms of dress kept reappearing every other decade. Who knows why. Perhaps they had run out of other fashions to wear, and they kept recycling old british attire and renaissance gowns. Either way, I continued to hold my glare. Yet I was not angry. No, how could one be angry at time-travelers? You saw them everywhere now-adays, if you knew how to look. No, it was the implication that followed them. Something was going to happen. And knowing my life, I knew it wasn\\'t going to be something good. The glare was a means of self-defense. To hide my fear. To hide my trembling lips. To hide the fact that I hoped against hope that they could not hear my pounding heart over the howling wind. An ominous breeze penetrated my coat and the icy wind made my body shiver. The freezing December air made me visibly shake, and the crowd following me let out a silent giggle. I eyed them viciously until they stuttered into silence. \"Weird,\" I thought to myself, \"Ever since the TTIP had been passed people had been acting..... malicious.\" I shook my head and kept walking. The Time-Traveling Insurance Progressive allowed nearly anyone to time-travel, even those hardened criminals who had gone through the justice system. but who knew why this particular group had gathered. \"Who knew what kind of satanical humor people were into these days.\" It wasn\\'t until I turned around and saw the smoke in the air did my nose register the poignant odor. I 180-ed in horror at the crowd behind me. This is what they were here for. I saw a small child, a girl no older than 10, sneak an evil smile at me from behind her mother\\'s hoisted gown. I knew what this was - They knew what this was. That was my house on fire. With this large of a crowd here, it was evident what had happened. They were here to watch the worst day of my life, like some kind of theatrical satire, taking joy in my own wretched misery. Even a child stood before me, glowing with joy at the prospect. She reminded me of Anna, my child, probably burned to a crisp in the fire. My loving wife, Regina, how we had struggled so hard to conceive. And how we were now so excited to begin to lovingly raise our daughter. No. This couldn\\'t be happening. It was all going so well. A Family. Love. The promotion. And here I was.

Eventually a tree will grow so large that it can no longer support itself so it falls over and a new little tree takes it\\'s place. You only think your hair stops growing because you are looking at ALL the hair, not individual hairs. If you look at individual ones you will notice that all of them are different lengths.

The hairs on your body go through growth and no-growth cycles, usually triggered by chemical signals in your body. During the growth phase, the hair follicle embeds in the skin (dermal), receiving nutrients from the bloodstream and allowing the cells lining the follicle to divide and create the protein chain that your hair is made of. After a few months, this phase stops, the follicle detaches from the blood supply and enters a rest phase. There is not actual growth, but the hair follicle is slowly pushed outwards as a new follicle grows below. Eventually, the old follicle is pushed out completely, causing the hair to fall out, and the cycle begins again with a new follicle. There is no conscious decision making in this process.

As I entered middle school I had dreams of becoming an architect. I always had this love of architecture and design. In my final year this evolved. When I thought about the future I no longer saw myself as just an architect. I still liked the idea of architecture and design but wanted something much more technical than that. As my final exams approached, it was obvious to me that the only aspects of architecture that interested me were those that were very closely tied to engineering. I realized that I wanted more time to figure out how exactly I wanted to steer my future studies and career. The universities in India do not offer a General Studies type program, and it is difficult to transfer to different colleges without starting from the beginning. Not wanting to waste time and effort heading in a direction that I did not have an interest in, I decided to invest some time to properly research the various choices available within India and my options abroad. After my exams the dilemma continued. In addition to engineering, my interests varied from psychiatry to economics. I had almost decided to take up Civil Engineering, but was not completely convinced. The FIFA World Cup was held in June. After a new-found interest in football, or soccer as it\\'s called in the United States, I enthusiastically watched all the late night fixtures. After a match one night, while browsing the channels, I came across a program on The National Geographic Channel that talked about how the Capital Gate building in Abu Dhabi was built. The entire process from conception of the idea to designing and finally completing construction fascinated me. From then on I always tried to watch that show. The structural engineers explained how they tackled several obstacles that they had to face to stay true to the architects\\' vision of the building. I didn\\'t know the level of originality a civil engineer required. From the slanting of the central core of the Capital Gate building to make sure the core does not break to the inclusion of the tuned mass damper sphere in the Taipei 101; the level of ingenuity required to be got me interested. I knew then that I wanted to be a structural engineer. The thought of the challenges I might face and the ideas I might come up with strengthens my desire to pursue Structural Engineering. The first time I saw a picture of the aerial view of the completed Burj Khalifa in Dubai it mesmerized me. To be a part of the great construction projects of the future is my goal, and I am determined to achieve it. As I considered my college options, Purdue University made top of my list. It\\'s ranking among the top 5 schools for Civil Engineering made it an obvious choice. The flexible curriculum would allow me to concentrate on a specialty of my choice. The reputed faculty and the lab intensive curriculum further adds to Purdue\\'s appeal. The large international community at Purdue suggests that being exposed to a large variety of cultures is possible and that it is a welcoming place for an international student. Purdue University is where I would like to start my professional journey by majoring in Civil Engineering.'),\n",

We will be consulting on these proposals shortly.\" The Ofsted chief says inspectors visited 28 institutions where there were concerns and found 15 unregistered schools. The schools that are still operating have not been identified, although some are believed to be in Birmingham and London. They include some linked to faith groups. These are schools providing at least 20 hours a week of lessons, operating outside the supervision of the Department for Education, local authorities or Ofsted inspections. Ofsted accuses the operators of some of these institutions of \"using the freedoms afforded to genuine home educators as a cover for their activities.\" But Sir Michael is calling on the education secretary for greater urgency in closing unregistered schools and in the response of councils and the Department for Education. And he warns against \"bureaucracy, legislation or lack of resources\" being used as a \"reason for inaction.\" In one \"deeply troubling case,\" Ofsted says inspectors had to return for a fifth visit to Bordesley independent school in Birmingham, which inspectors now believe has closed. Sir Michael says inspectors had been delayed from entering, but once inside had found \"squalid conditions, including three single mattresses covered in filthy sheets in one room and no running water in the toilet areas.\" There was also \"clear evidence of segregation, with separate classrooms for boys and girls\" and \"no evidence of appropriate vetting checks being carried out on staff.\" Inspectors also warned of \"pupils being taught a narrow curriculum that was failing to prepare them for life in modern Britain.\" Sir Michael\\'s letter says there were subsequent questions about rights of access for the local authority - and as such \"I arranged for police officers from the West Midlands force to accompany inspectors to facilitate entry to the premises.\" Mrs Morgan said: \"We understand Bordesley has now closed and are keeping in close contact with Birmingham local authority as they work to urgently ensure the children involved are safe and are receiving suitable education.\" The Ofsted chief has told the education secretary: \"The arrangements for closing down unregistered schools are inadequate. \"Too many children remain at significant risk of harm. I will continue to do all that I can to identify and inspect unregistered schools.\" Labour\\'s shadow education secretary, Lucy Powell, said: \"It is hard to fathom why arrangements for closing down unregistered schools remain inadequate and swift action on this issue has not been taken. \"With children at risk of being exposed to harm, exploitation or undue influences, more inertia from this government simply isn\\'t good enough.\" Ms Powell warned of a \"dangerous void\" in the local oversight of schools.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"To the principle\\n\\nI have heard that you are considering to require all students to perform community service. To be honest I think it's a great idea. But some students don't think it will be. But there is a large variety of things you can do for community service. For example, there is cleaning up litter, tutoring, cleaning other peoples yard, and a whole bunch of stuff.\\n\\nI think the one that is well liked by students is tutoring younger kids. It's actually a lot of fun! It actually makes you feel like you are a teacher. The younger kids will ask you a lot of questions about how to do their homework. But most of the time they catch on to it pretty quickly. Of course you will think that their stuff is easy. But remember, you more than likely had the same problems when you were their age. If students like tutoring other students, they will probably encourage other students to consider students for tutoring. Then maybe the principle will consider making it an elective for the school. Of course it won't be mandatory but it could be for students that enjoy tutoring younger students in a lower grade level. By my opinion, it's probably the most enjoyed by students than doing other stuff.\\n\\nMost students enjoy cleaning up their environment. For example, they clean up litter, pick up after pets, and growing trees and planting flowers. Some students get straight to it right after school. But most of the time students do it on their free time. I say free time because they probably have electives after school or play sports. Most students play sports after school to get a scholarship for a college they want to attend. Their practice only lasts for an hour or two. The best thing about community service and playing sports is that you have a lot of time to clean up your environment. Instead of cleaning up the environment, kids like to plant flowers and trees. I say the easiest thing to grow is flowers. Trees take longer to grow a full height then flowers take a couple of days. Trees take months or years to grow! Besides flowers come in a variety and you can choose what you want to grow. Trees grow into whatever they want to.\\n\\nThe last thing kids might interested to is cleaning up neighbors yards. Some people pay the kid like 5 dollars but some people don't pay them at all. It doesn't really matter if you get paid or not. You are doing a nice thing for your neighbor. He or she should appreciate that. Sometimes you just have to mow the lawn or pick up trash. So it's not really that complicated to clean up someone's yard. Well i guess it depends on how big the lawn is. If it's huge, then it wouldn't be hard to pick up trash but if your mowing the lawn, it might take you some time to finish. But on a good note, you did something nice for someone. They probably can't do it because they could be injured or something.\\n\\nThose are a couple of things you should consider doing for the school.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Electronic Auctions Concerns Essay\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n 1. The role of the information systems\\n 2. My opinion\\n 3. Controls on items sold in electronic auctions\\n 4. Ethical issues in electronic auctions\\n 5. Measures to address the ethical issues\\n\\nThe role of the information systems\\n\\nInformation systems that support online auctions act as excellent platforms on which buyers and sellers meet and transact business. Sellers of different items post their product specifications on the websites, and they wait for buyers to place bids.\\n\\nThe systems support prospective buyers to place their bids, and successful bidders are selected based on their value of bids, i.e., the highest bidders win. The information systems also play a great role in supporting electronic methods of payments made by bidders. Also, they are used to notify successful buyers when and how their products would be shipped.\\n\\nMy opinion\\n\\nIn my opinion, I believe that sellers should not post whatever they want without being sensitive to other people. Some auction items could offend some people on the internet. Sellers should evaluate the sensitivity of items for sale. If an item is found to cause much offense to people online, then it should not be auctioned on the internet.\\n\\nIt would be difficult for sellers to determine the degree of offense their items cause. The best way to assess the level of offense is to conduct a feedback survey focusing on how people rate offense caused by particular products.\\n\\nControls on items sold in electronic auctions\\n\\nControls should be placed on items sold in online auctions to enhance public trust and confidence. Controls would greatly minimize the number of fraud cases experienced in online auctions. First, there should be control to ensure proper identification of the items. Items should be presented in the form of images that are clear to prospective buyers.\\n\\nSellers should provide and verify their email and mailing addresses, and this ensures that buyers would be dealing with genuine sellers online. Second, identity theft controls should be implemented to prevent stolen items from being sold online.\\n\\nThis control could be supported by regulations and policies, sound recovery systems, and effective incident response plans. Third, repeated fees should be paid by sellers to post their products. This approach would be aimed to validate users and ensure that they post genuine products for sale.\\n\\nEthical issues in electronic auctions\\n\\nNon-delivery is a common unethical practice in online auctions. Unethical sellers alert buyers that they have shipped their products while they have not. Some unethical online sellers stack their fees, i.e., they charge undisclosed fees, making the actual cost of a product more expensive than a buyer expects.\\n\\nThe fees could be on product handling or shipment. Online auctions have also been characterized by prevalent cases of shill bidding. In shill bidding, friends or associates of online sellers pretend to place actual bids on items, and they ensure that prices go up to their anticipated levels.\\n\\nMeasures to address the ethical issues\\n\\nNon-delivery ethical issues could be addressed by adopting technologies that give buyers real-time information about the status of the shipment of goods. Also, it could be prevented by scanning shipment documents and sending them to buyers to confirm that their products have been shipped. Fee stacking could be addressed by making the terms and conditions clear to buyers before they could sign purchase agreement documents electronically.\\n\\nThis could ensure that they are prevented from paying hidden costs that are not covered in the terms and conditions. Shill bidding can be prevented by enforcing strict laws and regulations that prohibit friends and associates of online sellers from hiking prices of products unethically.\\n'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Eugene Atget: Biography Review Essay\\n\\nSome art historians believe that photography cannot be viewed as visual art. They try to prove their point by the fact that any kind of art changes, transforms life, or even distorts it; these people argue that photography is a mere copy of reality. It seems that this conclusion is very far-fetched. In my opinion, Eugene Atget proves that photography cannot be treated just as reproduction.\\n\\nI chose to emulate the works of this photographer because his photographs beautifully combine a realistic and aesthetic description of life. The fluidity of his forms eloquently represents the most peculiar features of modernism. Although Eugene Atget did not view himself as an artist, a great number of his works prove that photography also can change nature.\\n\\nIn his photographs, the author beautifully shows the interplay of light and shadow. His works show this unforgettable interplay between the imaginary and real-world, reality and reflection. It is worth mentioning that people in his pictures are often depicted as just reflections in the mirror. To my mind, it is one of the fascinating features of his style. To my mind, the message that he wants to convey is that we understand ourselves only through interactions with other people. Atgets photograph ㄹvenue des Gobelins is a bright example of the masters style.\\n\\nFigure 1. Atgets photograph ㄹvenue des Gobelins렢\n\\nThis photography belongs to the series of city landscapes made by Atget at the be the beginning of the twentieth century. It is worth mentioning that Paris has always been of great interest to the author. Certainly, this city is often considered a source of inspiration for many artists.\\n\\nMy intention was to emulate these city landscapes. I wanted to show that big city life is often some labyrinth of reflection, and it is often very difficult to distinguish between the imaginary world and reality. I attempted to adhere to the authors style, and therefore people have been depicted as reflections in the mirrors. It was very difficult for me to simulate Atgets ability to show the interplay between light and shadow.\\n\\nMoreover, one should always bear in mind that the equipment Atget used at the beginning of the twentieth century is drastically different from what we have now. The photographer had to operate without a wide-angle lens. It is believed that the focal length of Atgets lens was ranging from eight to eleven inches. I attempted to find such equipment, despite the fact that it is very rare. As it turned out, it was very difficult to shoot with such kind of apparatus.\\n\\nAdditionally, I found it very difficult to emulate his style, especially photographing people. As I have already, the author often perceives other people just as reflections in the mirror. These reflections are often so elusive. They seem to merge into a single entity with the landscape, as we can see in ㄹvenue des Gobelins This fluidity of lines is very difficult to capture. Certainly, I have attempted to pay tribute to his works. But it doe not seem to me that I have managed to successfully emulate all the peculiarities of the authors style. To some extent, I have managed to show that life in a big city can be viewed as some maze of reflections. For example, we make take such picture of mine:\\n\\n/var/www/blog-sandbox.itp/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/192126_2.jpg 438칑403 24bit N JFIF [OK] 48697 > 47224 bytes (3.02%), optimized.\\n\\nFigure 2. Paris series of Eugene Atget\\n\\nHowever, it cannot be compared with the Paris series of Eugene Atget.\\n\\nFrom this project have learned that photography can truly be the most difficult kind of visual art because the photographer has to see show the beauty of life without changing it, and it is very difficult to capture this moment.\\n\\nBibliography\\n\\nBeaumont Newhall.

Recently, most of people in the several countries do not have good enough speaking, it was mainly because too difficult speaking in front of the audience and other reason was they do not know the way how to be a good speaker. On the other word, he said that there were six steps to learn speaking like a leader:  \\n  \\nThe first was three breathless sentences. This way was often used by leader when they speaks in front of the public. Three breathless sentences mean that we speak 3 sentences or we use three words with good voice in one breath. The second was three repetitive sentences in the main points. It mean emphasing the important points of the topic to convince the audience. For example, I will create a new a good life, new idea, new concept and new freedom for this countries, in the future. Next was three balancing statements. Most of leaders in the world always use balancing statements when they speaking in the public. Their statement do not blaming in one topic or one object but they use the balancing data or real case. For illustrates, the leader speaks about nowadays so they are not only talk about present time but also speaking about past time and future time it was because several people that was interesting topic.

       " Document(page_content=\"***The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school.***  \\n## Agree or Disagree?\\n\\n  \\n  \\nBeing one of the major core skills in today's era of integration, cooperation has recently been brought into education. While advocates of team sports are of the opinion that these activities provide the best opportunities for students to practice cooperation, I believe that playing music in an ensemble could create such same effect.  \\n  \\nAdmittedly, cooperative physical activities could foster a sense of teamwork by acknowledging the members' abilities. When working in tandem with each other, each member of a team could gradually recognise the strengths and weaknesses of their teammates. From that, they will devise the best strategies that could cover their weak points while maximising their strengths. Football emerges as a typical case for this collective spirit, as the compatibility of the members is the result of experimental matches.  \\n  \\nAt the same time, I propose that a music ensemble is also capable of instilling in students a sense of unity. In order to interpret a score, each player in the ensemble has to be highly aware of how to deliver their interpretation in harmony with other players so as not to ruin the score. For example, if one student misses the tempo, the whole ensemble will have to stop. This delicate adjustment requires each player to look out for their partners, thus further strengthening the bond within the group.  \\n  \\nAll in all, while I concur with the opinion that teamwork spirit can be honed through team sports, I also consider a music ensemble to be a strong way to help bring members closer.  \\n  \\n(Thank you for your comment!)\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='As It Is in Heaven (2004) Essay\\n\\nThe film As It Is in Heaven (2004) dwells upon some of the most important planning issues. It portrays the difference between two cultures, urban and rural. It goes without saying that these two cultures shape people뗩 behavior and their ways of life.\\n\\nOne of the basic differences between the two cultures is community environment. For instance, in urban areas there can hardly be the notion of neighborhood, since in urban areas people are concerned with their problems and do not pay attention to what is going on around them. On the contrary, rural areas are characterized by certain community environment where people know each other, and often intervene in each other뗩 lives.\\n\\nIt is important to add that public opinion is what people in urban areas ignore in the majority of cases. People simply have no time to watch after someone else. Besides, there are far too many people in urban areas, so everyone is almost invisible in such a crowd. However, in rural areas people try to have positive image and take into account the public opinion, the opinion of people living in the neighborhood.\\n\\nThis peculiarity of rural areas is revealed in the film. For instance, many people (especially women) try to make their neighbors conduct in accordance with high morality. Such people as Siv even have no time for their private life since they keep an eye on the neighborhood.\\n\\nIt goes without saying that such peculiarities of culture shape people뗩 behavior. As far as urban areas are concerned, people enjoy much individual freedom and that is why they are bolder, so to speak. As for rural communities people do not have much of individual freedom. People are afraid to do something that can evoke negative attitude of neighbors.\\n\\nSome may say that it is good since people in rural areas are watched and will have to conduct properly. However, this is not the case. In rural areas people often misbehave, but try to conceal their inappropriate behavior. Thus, Gabriella is beaten by a husband and community did not affect her husband to prevent that disgraceful behavior.\\n\\nHowever, rural areas provide people with something that cannot be underestimated. In rural areas people feel the support of their neighbors and whenever something bad happens they can count on others to help them. There is almost nothing of this kind in urban areas where people often feel lonely and depressed because of the lack of support and even communication.\\n\\nI have experience in both cultures so I can point out positive and negative point in both of them. The negative facets of these cultures are as follows: in urban areas people are too distant from each other, and in rural areas it is sometimes quite hard to feel free.\\n\\nHowever, I must say that in rural area it is easier to live since people feel support and can count on their neighborhood. I was lucky to live in a rural area where people were not so concerned with morality, and there was quite a lot of individual freedom. Thus, every rule has exceptions, and in urban areas people sometimes feel support.\\n\\nOn balance, I would like to point out that proper and effective planning presupposes that all the peculiarities of these two areas are taken into account. Perfect area for living should include positive points of both cultures and should not have negative facets of these cultures.\\n'),\n",

This is left in the hands of few elites with little regard of the ideologies they hold leading to poverty and corrupt politics.\\n\\nAuthoritarian rule in Egypt has nurtured a perception that a small number of experts is capable of using a central approach in carrying out economic planning and making correct choices on behalf of an entire country뗩 population (Egypt, 2006). According to the authoritarian leaders of Egypt, central control is important in ensuring equal distribution of economic resources.\\n\\nHowever, the authoritarian rule benefits the political class since they are capable of evading poverty associated with the system. They have the ability to secure favor from the government for their own gains. This has greatly contributed towards the revolution and uprising that has been witnessed in Egypt (Egypt, 2006).\\n\\nMubarak and his authoritarian government have come up with many strategies to suppress Egyptians. For instance, social welfare organizations have been barred from offering service to the citizens who have been adversely affected by poverty and political marginalization.\\n\\nAmong the repressive laws constituted is the emergency law which makes the 1971 constitution useless.

       " Document(page_content='Sub-Prime as a Black Catastrophe by Melvin Oliver Essay\\n\\nIn the article called Sub-Prime as a Black Catastrophe, Melvin Oliver focuses on the side effects of the sub-prime mortgage system for African-Americans, including other minority groups and low-income populations. Specifically, this target population has received the highest ratio of loans due to their low social status, which also signified the problem of the wealth gap predetermined by racial indicators.\\n\\nBy introducing the challenges of the financial crisis, Oliver makes use of the mortgage breakdown as an indicator of racial inequality in the United States, which has increased significantly within the last two decades. Currently, the African American population experiences discriminative policies and racial segregation in terms of the opportunities to accumulate human capital.\\n\\nFurther, the article explores historical and social determinants of a sub-prime meltdown to explain the relationship between the need of the African American population in accumulating wealth in a much higher amount, as compared to American families whose requirements were much lower. The sharp contrast between these two groups undermines the domestic economy introduced by the U.S government.\\n\\nAt the end of the article, the author takes a closer look at racial targeting as the major reasons for the tangible wealth gap between the presented groups. Relying solely on house families, most African American families were in the pursuit of the American Dream. However, these attempts resulted in failure due to the inconsistencies in governmental policies. Focusing on bad loan policies as the main consequences of the crisis explains why lower-income communities were involved in the venture. Therefore, although the program was initially developed for increasing social welfare, its effect was even more detrimental.\\n'),\n",

In a VBR MP3 (Variable Bit Rate) the quality of the sound drops considerably during portions of silence or simple sound and rises during more complex sounds to reduce the size of the file, while allowing for high quality.\\', \"Lets say you have some tupperware containers, and some beans. These beans are all different. Different types, colors, and amounts. Now, lets say you have to sort these all into their own container. A regular mp3 is like putting all of the beans in tupperware containers that are the same size. Sometimes all of the beans dont fit, and you have to throw some away. Sometimes the beans only take up a tiny amount of space in the container. Now, with a Variable Bit Rate (VBR) mp3, you\\'re doing the same thing, except all of the containers match the amount of beans exactly. No wasted beans, no wasted space. That\\'s pretty much what a VBR mp3 does. When there isn\\'t any sound quality to be gained from a higher bitrate, the bitrate is lowered until it gets to the cusp of where if the bitrate was any lower, the sound quality would start to degrade. This makes for a smaller file, with just as good, and sometimes better sound quality than a much larger file would have.,It is very common to have entire MP3 files encoded to a \"constant bitrate\" of, for example, 320kbps. This is a high quality rip. It also requires a larger file size. Unfortunately, sometimes you\\'re encoding high quality empty space. This is wasteful and causes for bloated file sizes. VBR gives high quality where the quality is needed. You can set a maximum quality of 320kbps, but you can also allow for very low quality for the times when you\\'re basically listening to dead air. If done correctly, the overall quality doesn\\'t change, only the file size.\\',\\'Mp3 is a \"lossy\" compression algorithm. Basically, it takes the original song and only writes about the important chunks. You can control the number of chunks and detail with which to write about by picking a bit rate. The lower the bit rate, the less number of chunks you have and the smaller each chunk is, because you are making a more and more generalized estimate of what the original song was. The best mp3 compression is 320kbps. thats as high as it goes, and you can pretty much not tell the difference between it and the original file unless you paid a LOT of money for your audio setup. and even then its hit or miss. 320kbps mp3 takes up a LOT of room though, compared to other bit rates. A regular CD is 700mb or so. 320kbps mp3 will get it down to around 90-150mb, depending on the CD. Nowadays, this is pretty darn good. However, there are plenty of people who still simply dont have the space on their players. What if they cant decide between smaller file size vs higher quality? This is where variable bit rate comes in. The program that will be approximating the file starts approximating it and checks to make sure it isnt missing out on too much data. Some tracks, such as a single person talking or a single violin playing, dont have as much actual data as other tracks, such as an entire orchestra. They arent as loud and they dont hit anywhere near as many different notes (frequencies). These tracks can be approximated into a MUCH smaller space than the big fancy orchestra tracks. Variable bit rate just allows the program to adjust how specific its being within a certain range, whereas constant bitrate (normal) just stays exactly as specific as you tell it to be.'),\n",

A lot of us lost pride for our school because it seems more like a prison school. But I do appreciate some of my teachers at that high school who made an impact on my life. They showed me that they cared for my future, and they wanted me to succeed in life. I also appreciate my guidance coupler which is a UNC graduate. She introduced UNC to me and told me it'll be a great school for me to attend. Falling in love with the university she explained to me how great the professors are, how students have pride about their school, and how it is affordable. Andrews was an experience I wasn't too happy about but learning about UNC programs gave me hope for having a great lifetime experience. Not only does UNC have an astonishing campus, but it has a business school that will help me improve my entrepreneur skills. My father graduated from the University of Iowa and got an English degree, but his cooking struck an impact to my life. Ever since a kid I've wanted to become a magnificent chef. I've always had a passion for cooking delicious meals. Being a chef for my own seafood restaurant has been my dream career for years. Getting accepted to UNC will not only be life changing, but it'll motivate me to strive for excellence to catch this dream career.

This new tecnology can be very helpful for students. I believe it can be helpful to students because there are some people who feel depressed and it is complicated to tell if they are happy, depressed, or angry.\\n\\nThis can help students and adults to see how they are actually feeling because some people don\\'t even know how they feel. Some students might say \"that computer doesn\\'t know how I feel\" but the computer FACS(Facial Action Coding System) comes from a good sorce. The people who created \"FACS\" were Thomas Huang and Prof. Thomas Huang was from the Beckman institute fo advance at the University of Illinos working woth Prof. Therefore, they the system \"FACS\" is a trust worthy computer to identify your emotions.\\n\\nThis system can help students with their lifes. To demonstrate, in paragrapg 3 it states \"Eckman classified six basic emotions happyiness,suprised, anger, disgusted, fear,and sadness.\" when a student is feeling depressed (no students should feel like that) a teacher doesn\\'t know how the student is feeling out of the six basic emotions that Eckman descrided. Thus, the system will help teachers know how the student is feeling ;and if the student is not feeling good the teacher or the adult can ask why are they feeling that way and build a conection or a bond with the students.\\n\\nTeachers can find this system useful because when they are teaching they can see if their students are confused or bored. To illastrate, in paragraph 4 it states \" Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements\" which means that using video or images is a new way to find out how people are feeling. Therefore, teachers can see how their students are feeling and see if their class is boring or not and they can see if their stuents are learning anything. This is an example of how this new system can help students and teachers.\\n\\nAll of these are examples of how this system \"FACS\" can help students and that is is valuable.'),\n",

       " Document(page_content='The Pazzi Chapel and the Parthenon Comparison Essay\\n\\nArchitecture is another way to tell stories and shed light on numerous historical events and cultural peculiarities of the nation. Clearly, architects often find inspiration in works of other artists, those who created masterpieces in previous epochs. This is the case with the Pazzi Chapel located in the heart of Italy, Florence. It is obvious that Filippo Brunelleschi was inspired by one of the most majestic architectural masterpieces, Parthenon, located in Greece. The two temples have many features in common, as they both have an altar, they both occupy a place within a city and they are both based on the principle of mathematical perfection. At the same time, the two temples differ in their major use, in the type of people who attended them and in their meanings.\\n\\nAs far as similarities are concerned, it is possible to stress that the two buildings are both characterized by mathematical perfection (see fig. 1). Parthenon has a rectangular form that is emphasized by the use of columns (Hurwit 18). The use of space is remarkable as the temple is very airy and people feel the glory of deities in it. The Pazzi Chapel also has a rectangular form adorned with columns (Kleiner 442). Notably, the use of the massive dome could create a feeling of round spaces but it only stresses the perfect geometrical forms chosen by the architect. Of course, the use of space also aims at creating the specific atmosphere in the temple. The geometrical perfection is also emphasized by the use of altars on axis with the front doors of both temples. It is also important to add that both temples have quite a specific location as they are surrounded by other buildings. The temples are integrated into the urban setting, which is quite common for religious sites. Each of the temples is situated on the hill. This stresses the grandeur of the temples.\\n\\nHowever, the two temples are quite different. For instance, they were used differently. The Pazzi Chapel was used for educational purposes. Higher ranks of clergy and nobility also gathered there (Kleiner 442). Apart from that, there was also a place to bury the richest representatives of the city. When it comes to the Parthenon, this was a sanctuary of the goddess Athena, but, more importantly, it was used as a treasury (Hurwit 32). Of course, different people attended the two temples. The Pazzi Chapel was predominantly attended by nobility and priests, while the Parthenon was visited by priests. Finally, the two temples had quite different meanings. The Pazzi Chapel was to reveal the might of the city and its richest families while the Parthenon was a symbol of the victory of the Greek (civilized) nation over barbarians. Thus, in the former case, wealth was glorified, while the glory of civilization was emphasized in the latter case.\\n\\nFigure 1. The Pazzi Chapel and the Parthenon\\n\\nIn conclusion, it is possible to note that the Pazzi Chapel is based on the same principle as the architecture of Parthenon is. This suggests that Filippo Brunelleschi found inspiration in the Greek architecture. Of course, the temples were constructed in different epochs and, hence, they differed significantly in their use and meanings. However, it is possible to note that the two architectural masterpieces have the same meaning at present, as they are people뗩 cultural heritage.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nHurwit, Jeffrey M.

In my opinion, I consider that physical strength lays the foundation for sportsmen's success on their fields.  \\n  \\nOn the one hand, it is sometimes thought that being physically agile is the basis of success and I agree. In order to reach the aspired level of physical fitness, sportsmen often subject themselves to a balanced, well-developed diet and exercise regimen. This is essential when it comes to physically demanding sports such as football, basketball, boat sailing, weight lifting which require a high level of stamina and endurance to perform well. Some sport stars, however, have even chosen to take shortcuts by using illegal substances such as doping to sustain physical condition and reach top performance which pays the heavy price for their career.  \\n  \\nOn the other hand, it is common belief that mental agility plays the prime role sportsmen's accomplishment. Failures and disappointment are common in sports, so it is vital that one be mentally strong to overcome these and achieve the best. If sportspeople can not foster a good spirit, they are more susceptible to successive failures and low morale. Another reason why mental strength is of great importance is that athletes can sometimes find workout tedious and repetitive. Therefore, they must be trained mentally to stay focused and sustain their motivation which will, consequently, produce better sport performance and output.  \\n  \\nIn conclusion, despite people having different perspectives, I believe that sportsmen stand a better chance to succeed if they are physically fit.  \\n  \\n(269 words)\"),\n",

Driverless cars are not a good idea because of the ability for faulty accuse in an accident, vehicles are not truly driverless, and the privacy of the driver.\\n\\nAccidents happen all the time and it is usually fairly easy to see who is at fault in the situation. That completely changes with Driverless cars. If they were to be manufactured and put on the road so many new laws would have to be made and old laws would have to be changed in order to cover liability in an accident. Technology does not always work out how its supposed to, no matter how hard the manufacturers want it to, so if something were to happen to the cars technology and an accident occured who would be at fault - the driver or it\\'s manufacturer?\\n\\nDriverless cars are not real. In order for a car to be completely driverless there should not be a driver in the front seat. With \"Driverless\" cars an alert driver has to take over when pulling in or pulling out of driveways or dealing with traffic issues. That is the complete opposite of what drivers want. Drivers do not want to deal with the traffic issues or the navigation through accidents, that is what most people hate about driving. So why would they want those to be their only priorities when driving? They don\\'t.\\n\\nSo much of everyones lives today are always being watched ; most people want to get as much privacy as they can in their day-to-day lives. By using cameras in order to watch if the driver is paying attention or not is safe, but also an invasion of privacy. It is understandable why manufactuers would want to have the cameras, safety reasons, but really in all actuality the cameras and sensors would become something drivers become accustomed to and they will completely ignore it all together.\\n\\nDriverless cars may be a thing of the future but it all comes down to the buyers. If drivers don\\'t want to worry about whether or not their gonna be at fault in a accident, if they actually have to drive, or if they want their personal lives invaded ; they most likely won\\'t buy the car.

       " Document(page_content=\"Almost everyone who attended school can attest to how boring and tedious summer work can be. Whether it's assigned reading or a project, students often dislike having schoolwork cut into their summertime. However, it is a necessary evil, and although there are compelling arguments for self-directed learning and independent study, the fact remains that it's the teacher's job to know how to help their students learn. Summer work should be designed via a partnership of students and teachers, so that students can learn in ways that interest them and help them grow, and teachers can ensure that the material is taught correctly.\\n\\nWhile the intervention of teachers in this process may seem to be too controlling or unnecessary, the fact remains that they have gone through a lengthy process to ensure that they are trained to teach the material as effectively as possible. They go through an extensive process involving obtaining at least a bachelor's degree as an undergraduate student (and in many cases going even further and pursuing post-graduate studies), spending time as a student teacher, obtaining other certifications, and taking part in continuing teacher training throughout their careers. The experience and education that teachers have is simply too much to ignore when considering the development of a student's summer project or curriculum.\\n\\nAnother factor to consider when advocating for students developing their own projects or curriculum is that all students are different. Some may not design their own work with their own best educational interests in mind, and others may not do as well learning via a highly structured summer project or curriculum. Yes, some students are very bright or passionate and will diligently undertake projects and studies on their own, but that is not true for all students. Everyone learns differently, and many people thrive in situations where they have specific guidelines and rules to follow or goals to meet. The wide range of learning and personality types in schools is a major reason why summer projects and curricula should be a collaborative effort between students and teachers. No two students learn the same, so why should they be forced to do the same work?\\n\\nAlthough there are many good reasons for students doing projects that were designed by a teacher, it is also important to consider the fact that teachers may simply be out of touch with how their students wish to learn. Student-designed work can be incredibly fulfilling upon completion; the student will have identified an area of study they enjoy, pursued and researched it, and hopefully will have reached a fulfilling conclusion through a project, experiment, or assignment. However, all of this can be accomplished to its fullest potential with the help of an adult. A trusted mentor (such as a teacher), can be an invaluable resource to a young person undertaking a major project on their own.\\n\\nMuch of education deals with absolutes. Standardized testing, graduation requirements, etc., etc. One can go on and on describing all of the things that individuals must do to conform with the school system. All of this is necessary to ensure that all students find success. However, summer work is a wonderful opportunity for a student's individuality to shine through, and with the help of a teacher, they can design work that will be fulfilling and extremely educational.\"),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Because it\\'s a big country and\\'laying cable for internet\\' isn\\'t a sexy enough infrastructure project to justify the effortcost for politicians seeking reelection.,\" \"One of the biggest factors is population density. If you look at Japan or Korea, they have tons and tons of people in a very small area. That means that it\\'s easy to lay out some super-high-quality fibre-optic cable and connect millions of people to it and installing underground cables and equipment is expensive, so that\\'s important. Then look at Australia. Australia is enormous (the size of the continental US if you chop Florida off), but has only 22 million people. The people, even in urban areas, tend to be much more spread out than people in other countries, which means that laying down 1 square mile of cable and equipment will get you fewer customers, meaning less profit, and less incentive to put high-quality equipment everywhere. Here are some fun population density statistics for first-world nations. Singapore: 19,544 people per square mile Hong Kong: 16,876 people per square mile Netherlands: 1,287 people per square mile South Korea: 1,303 people per square mile Japan: 873 people per square mile United States Alaska): 104 people per square mile Australia: 8 people per square mile Assume that there are 2.5 people per home, and that every home is willing to pay for a 50month internet connection. The Australian internet company will then get 128month revenue per square mile it services, and the American will get 1,664, while a Dutch company will get 20,592. If it costs 200,000 to install a high-speed internet network over 1 square mile that will win you lots of customers, then the Dutch company will leap at the opportunity, because it would only take a year for that to pay for itself, and then the company would come out really popular. It would take the American company 10 years, and the Australian company more than a century, so they wouldn\\'t do it.

       " Document(page_content='Analysis of Mending Wall by Robert Frost Report (Assessment)\\n\\nRobert Frost뗩 poem Mending Wall was published in the collection North of Boston (1914). It is written in blank poetry and shows a couple of neighbors cooperating on the annual maintenance of their shared wall. The wall acts as a symbolic fulcrum for their friendly rivalry, balancing their differing philosophical perspectives on brotherhood.\\n\\nFrost뗩 Mending Wall was released in 1914 and became one of modern literature뗩 most widely studied poems. In the poem, a New England farmer walks with his neighbor to fix a stone wall that separates their two farms. The narrator began to doubt the necessity for the wall and its practical and symbolic implications as they began to repair it.\\n\\nThe poem Mending Wall by Robert Frost examines the nature of human interactions. When the neighbors begin to repair the main symbol of the poem  the wall  both the narrator and reader begin to inquire about the overall necessity of the wall. The reader examines, philosophizes, and digs deep in an attempt to arrive at a specific conclusion.\\n\\nMending Wall by Robert Frost is a great example of the appropriate feel and tone, which is exceptionally resonating. This is not last because of the author뗩 diction and use of basic colloquial words. The poem is also distinguished by its lack of pretentious vocabulary and unnecessarily complicated arrangement.\\n\\nRobert Frost뗩 Mending Wall offers a reader a deeper perspective on boundary barriers. This poem also emphasizes the significance of borders and walls between countries and communities. Nowadays, when the wall serves as a barrier for many people, it is also beneficial to respect the neighbor뗩 private life.\\n\\nSince humanity builds and destroys borders, the Mending Wall analyzes paradoxes in life and mankind, including conflicts inside each individual. It also looks at the significance of borders in human society since the wall뗩 repair serves to divide and join the two neighbors, which is a paradox. The wall also balances their opposing philosophical views on boundaries: Good fences are good neighbors as opposed to There is something that doesn뗪 like walls (Frost, 1934). Seasons as repeating life cycles are also explored in Mending Wall, which contrasts these cycles with physical and verbal parallelism as men walk along the wall, each to the side, and their dialogue is left out.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nFrost, R.

       " Document(page_content='Neck craning just enough to allow the small tips of my hair to kiss my eyelids, eyes flicking rapidly between the beautifully intimidating historic cement and mortar, and pupils widening ever so slightly to take in the vast and absolute wonder that is New York City as I take solid, measured steps across the beaten and battered walkway, careful not to miss a single thing while maneuvering through the rushing crowds. The light dances between the windowpanes at every angle, sparkling brilliantly as if it knows just how to embody the life of this thriving metropolis. \"C\\'mon, we\\'re going to be late for the tour!\" My father\\'s voice struggles to make the trip to my ears between the roar of the people and my foggy, awed state. I speed up my steps in an attempt to keep pace with his while we rush to the subway. \"They sure don\\'t have anything like this at home, huh?\" No, they certainly don\\'t, I thought. My thoughts flicker back to the vast desert I\\'ve known all my life which by far paled in comparison. His excitement mirrors my own as the impatience for the arrival of the subway car grew. What others regard as mundane, need-based transportation screeches to a sharp halt in front of me, I saw only as my most thrilling adventure yet. The doors open and the riders pour out, as synchronized and fluidly as tipping milk out of the carton. The campus, like everything else in the city, did not fail to disappoint. As the guide directs us through the halls and buildings of the institution, my awe-like state returns, more powerfully than ever. I could feel my passion grow with every syllable the guide spoke. The buildings, the classes, the prestige: I was hooked. The flight home is a long one, filled with endless daydreams of what I could only hope would one day become reality. As the plane hits the runway, the familiar mountains and rust-stained earth welcome me home, but I can\\'t shake the feeling that this isn\\'t where I belong. The lights of the Strip glow just as bright, but the love I feel towards them is more of a loyalty to my home rather than the immense passion I feel for New York City. Years pass, filled with challenging exams, well-earned rewards, playful times, and the always present chaos of life. The time soon came when classes began to center around future plans and the upcoming college life. The one question everyone asks surrounds me: where are you going to college? Every single time, the images of my adventure in New York City and daydreams of attending New York University fill my imagination. My friends become numb to the excitement I felt, after hearing my life being mapped out so perfectly in my dream city, attending my dream school, over and over again. I cannot be tamed; I am a woman on a mission, stopping at nothing to achieve my dreams. Then, finally, the application is opened. I leave the webpage open on my screen for days, staring at the questions. My fingers shake with the anxiety of it all as I fill the boxes with my story, and they shake now as I write this. My dreams on the line, I know I have to give it absolutely everything I have. The entire city is a masterpiece fashioned with only the boldest colors, and I, like so many others before me, was seduced by the beauty.'),\n",

Not even at lunch; people are dangerous. If you haven\\'t heard on the news recently, but they said that teens that text a lot, have a larger chance of starting to do drugs.\\n\\nSchool is to go to learn, not text with or call anyone. During lunch, you can have conversations with people by speaking with them in person. What other school do you think has students allowed to text. If there is a rule that students cannot walk around in the cafeteria of Home Room, you should lift that rule. If you give them the opportunity to use cell phones in school, there is a large chance that students will not obey that rule.

It is alright to bring them to school with them to stay in communication after school ends, but During School?\\n\\nThere is also going to be a larger chance that you will get many complaints if you use Policy 1.

This is one of the option for those students that want finished the schools. This option can help them. They can take the classes from theirs home without go to the school and according the time that they have.

       " Document(page_content='The particles given off by the radioactive material slam into the DNA of a person. This causes damage to the genetic code of how the cells and therefore the body work. The result is, basically, the body sort of falls apart and organs fail, or tumors arise and take over. At some point, if enough damage cannot be overcome, the body ceases to function correctly and the person dies. This is rather dependent on how much exposure to the radiation there wasis to the person. Referring to a non-radioactive object becoming radioactive, this is simply that a radioactive material has contaminated the object. If you can possibly scrubclean the object from the radioactive material, then it is no longer radioactive. The other way is to wait for the radioactive material to decay down to a material that is not radioactive, but depending on the material, that can be tens of thousands of years. Or dilute the radioactive material to a point that it\\'s just not enough to do any lasting damage to a person. As far as why some material is naturally radioactive.... certain atoms simply have more stuff in them, if you will, and cannot hold themselves together. They eventually will decay down to a stable atom, but again, depending on the forces and atom makeup, this could take thousands of years or a few milliseconds. Edit: Interestingly, the DNA damaging happens all the time, from UV or radiation or mutation or just\\'luck\\'. But the body\\'s self repair systems can overcome the majority of these aberrations, it\\'s when there\\'s a MASSIVE amount of damaged cells, andor the cells are growingmultiplying out of control (and the body can\\'t tell they\\'re bad ones) is when this type of thing becomes the deadly problem.,\" \"You\\'re correct about what radiation is. An unstable atom is decaying and since energy cannot be created or destroyed, it is emitted. This emitted energy, will be ejected from the atom and can hit human cells. Radiation is harmful to humans because it ionizes the water in our cells and generates free radicals. Free radicals are very unstable and will react with things almost instantaneously. Our cells have several ways of dealing with free radicals, but sometimes the free radicals react with things inside the cell. They can react with proteins, the cell membrane or DNA. All of which are bad, but DNA is the one we hear most about. If DNA gets a mutation, it is normally noticed by one of the several DNA repair mechanisms we have, but sometimes these fail to fix the problem. If they don\\'t fix the mutation these cells can divide uncontrollably, causing cancer. We also have mechanisms to detect cells that are carcinogenic, but again these guys can fail too. In short, the division and proliferation of cells is very tightly controlled. We need to replace the cells no faster than they are dying a natural death. Radiation can disrupt this by mutating DNA which removes the tight control and cells will divide uncontrollably, resulting in cancer. Edit: I have no idea about radioactive water firing off radiation. Sorry, hopefully somebody can chime in.,\" \"What you\\'re referring to is called ionizing radiation from uranium and other large, unstable atoms. It\\'s so harmful to living tissue because the radioactive particles they emit can literally ionize the atoms that make up the proteins in your DNA. This manipulates the charges and causes many biological molecules to break down. It\\'s so bad for you because it gets in your DNA. Radiation poisoning is literally when your cells start to break down and decay on an individual level and death usually follows with the failure of whichever vital bodily function is the first to collapse.'),\n",

The model is a recent variant of the Polya urn, introduced and studied in, which is characterized by a \"local\" reinforcement, i.e. a reinforcement mechanism mainly based on the most recent observations, and by a random persistent fluctuation of the predictive mean. In particular, this latter feature is capable of capturing the trend fluctuations in the sentiment curve. While the proposed model is extremely general and may be also employed in other contexts, it has been tested on several Twitter data sets and demonstrated greater performances compared to the standard Polya urn model.

       " Document(page_content='The Comparison of Gilgamesh and Odysseus Essay\\n\\nBy comparing such literary works as the Epic of Gilgamesh and Odyssey, one can gain valuable insights into the cultures and societies described by the authors.\\n\\nThis paper is aimed at discussing the journeys undertaken by the main characters; in particular one should focus on their motives of the protagonists and the way in which both Gilgamesh and Odysseus were transformed in the course of their adventures. This discussion can throw light on the values and beliefs of people who could live many centuries ago.\\n\\nAt first, it is important to speak about the motives that prompted the epic heroes to leave their homeland. For instance, one can mention that Odysseus was forced to go to the Trojan War. At the very beginning he wanted to remain at Ithaca, but he was compelled to join the army of Agamemnon and Menalaus. In contrast, Gilgamesh was willing to undertake this journey. Moreover, he is driven by several motives.\\n\\nFor instance, he is willing to leave a semi-god called Humbaba because this victory can gain him fame and recognition of other people. On the whole, this example can throw light on the differences between the culture of Ancient Greece and Sumer. The behavior of Odysseus indicates that Greeks emphasized the devotion to home country or family. In turn, the culture of Sumer attached importance to power and glory.\\n\\nMore about The Odyssey\\nWhat are the allusions in the Odyssey?\\n5\\n784\\nWhich part of the Odyssey is about learning patience and humility?\\n5\\n1196\\nWhich Greek values are found in The Odyssey?\\n4.7\\n5675\\nWhy Telemachus murdered the maids and Melanthius?\\n5\\n329\\nWhat are Odysseus뗩 Strengths and Weaknesses?\\n5\\n5108\\nWhy Odysseus is an Example of a Dynamic Character?\\n5\\n1868\\n\\nAdditionally, it is vital to discuss how the journey affected both Odysseus and Gilgamesh. In the course of his travels, Odysseus encountered many difficulties and in some cases, he had to use cunning, brutal force, and sometimes even cruelty in order to survive and return to Ithaca. Furthermore, he could remain with Calypso. Nevertheless, he remains loyal to his wife Penelope and his homeland.\\n\\nIn turn, Gilgamesh becomes transformed in the course of his adventures. It is difficult for him to accept the idea that he is mortal. In turn, Odysseus does not even try to acquire the status of a deity. Again, the experiences of the main characters can reflect very important differences between the cultures of Greece and Sumer. Greeks recognized the limitations of a human being. Yet, one can say the same thing about Sumerian culture in which individuals could claim the status of a deity.\\n\\nSpecial attention should be paid to the role played by female protagonists. Their behavior can also tell the readers about the values and beliefs of different cultures. For instance, Penelope remains faithful to her husband even though he has been absent from Ithaca for many years. More importantly, she rejects the offering of her suitors. This character shows that Greek women were responsible for maintaining families and households.\\n\\nOne can even argue that Penelope뗩 difficulties are much greater than the challenges faced by Odysseus. The Epic of Gilgamesh gives a different portrayal of women. For instance, Ishtar falls in love with Gilgamesh. However, the protagonist is afraid of her. Moreover, the readers should take into account that unlike Gilgamesh, Ishtar is a deity. So, it is possible to say that the culture of Sumer culture could give a very high social status to women.\\n\\nOverall, the comparison of these literary works can increase readers understanding of Sumer or ancient Greek culture. Homer뗩 epic indicates at such values as marital fidelity, devotion to homeland, and acceptance of human limitations, especially mortality. In turn, the Epic of Gilgamesh stresses power, fame, and recognition of others.\\n'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Cultural Influences on Family Values and Habits Essay\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n 1. Introduction\\n 2. Attitude to Communication with Children\\n 3. External Factors\\n 4. Conclusion\\n 5. Works Cited\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThe formation of cultural competence and basic habits of behavior is largely due to the background of people and their established way of life. Many forms of communication, interaction, and approaches to work are the reflection of those skills and abilities that were obtained in the past and serve as the source of existing experience. The cultural influence of the family is perhaps the most significant factor determining personal life transitions and attitudes to different everyday aspects. Copying can be unconscious; nevertheless, these are basic habits that largely determine the character of the person뗩 future way of life. Therefore, one of the primary sources of cultural influence is family traditions and values \\u200b\\u200blaid down in childhood.\\n\\nAttitude to Communication with Children\\n\\nHaving a close relationship with relatives, a person often adopts the manner of behavior of their loved ones. Perhaps, therefore, Chan claims that the fate of one family member can be influenced by the behavior of the other if there is a close relationship between them (71). The tradition of spending time with children, celebrating holidays in a close circle, pleasing one another with gifts  all these habits, as a rule, remain with people in adulthood.\\n\\nThe US way of life largely determines the peculiarities of upbringing. Walking to the beach in summer and to the pool in winter is a typical American pastime. However, even following some of the local trends, it is possible to preserve native traditions, regularly maintaining the customs of the family and incorporating them into the US culture. Very often, children do not need to be aware of the worries of adulthood, and all they need is to understand that they are taken care of and are supported by their parents (Accawi 88). Thus, attitudes toward loved ones can be learned from experiences that parents have.\\n\\nExternal Factors\\n\\nIn addition to family values \\u200b\\u200band habits, some external factors can have a significant impact on people뗩 cultural preferences. As an example, the idea of \\u200b\\u200bSchildkrout can be taken who notes that the tradition to decorate the body in various ways has a global trend, and this practice has been adopted for many centuries (79). Also, the circle of communication is one of the crucial factors influencing cultural preferences of people. As Grande remarks, some acquaintances and friends who have a strong impact on a person form persistent preferences concerning certain life phenomena, which can also take a beginning in childhood (95). Therefore, external factors are no less important than family traditions and the type of upbringing.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThus, cultural background is, in fact, the reflection of the human experience and preferences and is formed due to established habits that have their roots in the past. Family traditions and values play an essential role in the process of developing an individual culture and preferences regarding specific situations. In addition to behavioral patterns that are adopted from childhood, the circle of communication is of great importance in the process of personality development and the formation of cultural interests.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nAccawi, Anwar F.

With the development of genetically modified foods has come large surpluses in farms across the world while allowing for the creation of crops that can aid third world countries in their efforts to feed themselves instead of relying on foreign aid, or in cases where foreign aid occurs, the countries supplying the aid have excess amounts of food to donate to countries in need. The only argument that I have seen against GMO\\'s are not based in actual scientific studies or evidence, and instead are based on the personal opinions of people who have no actual expertise in the subject or are morally opposed to the process or the actors involved in the process of creating GMO\\'s (Monsanto for example) instead of opposing them for legitimate reasons such as deleterious effects on the health of individuals which consume GM foods. Instead people tend to oppose GMO because they do not understand the science behind it or misunderstand the science behind it. To quote uMacStylee: It\\'s like saying the destination you reach is defined by the mode of transport taken. There\\'s an idea that there is somehow \"natural\" genetics, and unnatural genetics. That if you place DNA into organisms using selective breeding it\\'s OK, and using some recently discovered method it\\'s not. This is close to exactly the same as saying vitamin C from limes or potatoes is OK, but not from some evil Pharma company. Your body cannot differentiate the source, Vit C is Vit C.

That\\'s not to say Monsanto or Evil Pharma aren\\'t bastards. They pretty much are, but one must separate understanding genetics with some gang of assholes from Harvard Business School eager to gouge people out of as much money as possible. In conclusion: There are no actual reasons to oppose GMO\\'s on a purely health basis and those who believe that there are do not understand the process of genetically modifying an organism, nor do they understand the results and what we, as a species, gain from them.

In the event of a tie the election will be passed to the House of Representatives, because each state only gives one vote allowing states with meager population to have the same holding as states that represent millions upon millions and given the information that voters may vote one party to president and another for congress, the house\\'s selection can hardly be reminiscent of the choices of the people that each one person represents.\\n\\nThe Electoral College is unfair because the candidatesknow which states will vote for them and which states definately wont and the ones that they might be able to find their way in favor. for example in \"the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all\"-The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong. jeopardising the validity of the entire capaign by putting the votes in the hands of swing voters to see who wins favor with visits to poor elementary schools and weak middle school student council campaigning by promising free ice cream and kissing babies.\\n\\nThe Electoral College needs to be thrown out there is no fixing what is already widely regarded as an anachronism. the Electoral College is a flawed system and maybe in some utopia it might work but not in america it wont there is too much at stake to keep trying to mske it work       \\xa0       \\xa0       \\xa0       \\xa0       \\xa0       \\xa0       \\xa0       \\xa0       \\xa0       \\xa0       \\xa0       \\xa0       \\xa0       \\xa0       \\xa0       \\xa0    '),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Politics is everywhere and it rules our everyday lives. Each United States citizen has a role in choosing how our politics can operate. It might not be a huge role but it definitely is an important small role. The presidential election happens every four years on the first tuesday of November. There is an electoral college which is the compromise between election of president by vote in congress and by popular vote of citizens. As state senator, I think you should keep the electoral college running because it is a safer option than just doing election by popular vote.\\n\\nThe electoral college consists of professionals in congress that are more specialized in politics then an average citizen is. The electoral college should be handed the trust to control our politics. There must be a majority of 270 electoral votes to elect that President. Each candidate running for president must have his or her own electoral group. The electors are chosen by the candidates political party, which means the person running for President if in good hands with his electoral college.\\n\\nAl Gore lost the presidency, but he won the popular vote. Maybe the professionals in the electoral college saw a flaw in him that the average citizen would not see. 60% of people prefer doing the direct election popular vote. The direct election would only satisfy themselves temporarily, but what if this president that got elected put the whole country in a downfall. Then people would realize how important the electoral college is.\\n\\nThere are some cases where the election process ends up being a disaster. What if citizens weren't able to chose the electors and the state legislatures were fully in charge of choosing those electors. Well, the electors can still chose to go by what the people want. In 1960, the segregationist almost replaced Democratic electors with the new electors that opposed John F. Kennedy. Some electors have even went against their political party's candidate and only choose who they wanted to chose. The segregationist that were in power at that time only wanted what they thought was best for them and not what was best for the people. Situations like this must require the votes and thoughts of the average citizens combined with the electoral college.\\n\\nThe electoral college has voters voting for electors only and not the president. The electoral college should stick around forever. Popular votes might not always be the best option. The citizens still have a say in which electors shall be chosen and that plays a part in electing the president. Even though voters are not always able to control who the electors vote for, they still have a part in chosing who will be president.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The Influence of Music on a Person Essay\\n\\nNowadays, people are often exposed to various influences that positively and negatively affect their consciousness. These sources include music, which is an integral part of life. Cook notes that music, like no other art, can influence mood (11). All musical works can be conditionally divided into activating and, relaxing, and soothing. Cheerful and energetic music, influencing the human psyche, replaces sadness with joy and optimism. In turn, calm and smooth music will help relax and calm down, distract from everyday worries, reduce the number of thoughts and focus on self-regulation. Slow and relaxing music affects a person like a sleeping pill. For example, after a hard busy day, the first thing I do when I cross the house threshold is turn on my favorite songs to relax. On the contrary, in the morning, I turn on upbeat and rhythmic music that helps to wake up and energize me for the whole day.\\n\\nClassical music comprehensively influences a person, including such recognized geniuses as Vivaldi, Mozart, Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Schubert, and Schumann. On the one hand, classical music has a relaxing effect, relieves fatigue, soothes, and improves mood and sleep. On the other hand, it increases the ability for intellectual activity and even strengthens the body뗩 immune defenses. According to Cook, classical music is played by employees in some companies because it affects the brain, making a person work much better (32). It is noteworthy that it does not distract but rather allows one to concentrate.\\n\\nHowever, such activities as listening to music should not be protracted. It can negatively affect the human psyche. If the melody is too loud, or the genre is not acceptable, then it will be perceived as extraneous noise, destructively affecting his general condition. I have repeatedly noticed that when I am somewhere where unpleasant music is playing, I become nervous, anxious, and worried. Thus, a person can control his emotions, and physical and mental state thanks to a suitable selection of melodies that benefit the body. Selectivity will help avoid negative and harmful effects on health and charge with positive energy.\\n\\nWork Cited\\n\\nCook, Nicholas. Music: A Very Short Introduction .

His eyes went back to his paperwork on top of the desk, going from left to right over words that he couldn\\'t comprehend. His pen, in turn, wrote unintelligible words as well. Reading over the name of the senator that sent him the letter, an image of her flashed in his head, and after, a red button. After a few minutes, he looked down at the work that he was not aware he did, and leaned back in his chair and looked out the window. He saw annoying tourists walking the grounds, heard the deafening buzzing of his phone remind him of meetings to be had, and he scowled at the weather. His eyes looked at the button once more, and his heart moved up through his chest to his head, beating loudly so he couldn\\'t hear the buzzing of the phone, blood blinding his eyes to be pure red, and his mind replaced with the thought of the button. Slowly his hand edged towards the button, crawling up on it, and, with gentleness he knew not he had, pressed in. Silence. Nothing comes after the button rises back with your finger. The president was expecting more, maybe something exciting, maybe something dangerous, but outside, tourists were still peacefully taking pictures of the white house, a schedule was still to be had, and the clouds gently floated across the soft, blue sky. Looking outside, the president was not sure if he was disappointed or not. He reached for a cup of coffee which had long gone cold and forgotten, hidden beneath the papers he had to read and analyze. He sipped it gently, watching the clouds do as they would. Before he finished, The secretary of defense rushed into his office, sweating and dry mouthed. \"Mr President! Rogues have somehow managed to launch our entire supply of nuclear weapons! We expect Russia to be hit within minutes, they might return fire!\" The clouds continued to float, and the tourists strolled across the lush green grass, while gentle hum of a phone was going off in the President\\'s pocket; and the President chose to acknowledge these events rather to speak to the secretary. He took out his phone, and decided to ignore the meetings, and do whatever he wished. He was president after all. After a few minutes of ignoring the screaming of white house members, which had entered loudly yet unnoticed to the president, the intense sound pounding at his ear drums, he stood up in front of them all. They all stared at him, mouths agape, noticing only now he was crying. His words shocked them, despite how softly they were delivered: \"My fellow staff, I made a great error today. I pressed the button here under the desk, which Kennedy himself had refused to press through the cold war, but I realize now we will all pay for this action, as it caused something awful\" He threw his phone on the ground infront of them, and through the cracked screen they realized the horrible truth, the true purpose behind the button. they noticed this all and more as they saw that he had gotten the purple button flair.'),\n",

I then underwent a surgery by putting a metal stick through my chest and push the sternum out.

Back Back then, when the subject was new to the community, I was one of the experimental patients, hence, the result wasn't as good, and I can still see and feel the Rectus Excavated to some degree. The process was undoubtedly a painful one, a few months of having unendurable pain when coughing, sneezing, getting up, or laying down, plus no contact sport for three years.

Sightings of the animal sparked a search involving hundreds of emergency services workers, animal-trackers and a helicopter. But experts now say the animal is most likely a much less dangerous animal, such as a lynx or large domestic cat. They made their conclusions based on inspecting animal tracks. It remains unclear where the animal came from, though there is a big cat park near Montevrain. A source told AFP that the search had been scaled back for the moment and the helicopter grounded, although forces remained \"mobilised\" in case of a fresh alert. The BBC\\'s Hugh Schofield in Paris says police had suggested there was probably not too much to worry about, but the authorities still sent out officers with guns and tranquilisers. The hunt has focused on areas near the Disneyland Paris theme park. There was a fresh alert on Friday morning after paw prints were discovered near a service station east of Paris. To reach there, the animal had apparently crossed the A4 motorway. Police guarded the entrances to schools in the Montevrain area in case the cat turned up, as a helicopter with thermal imaging hovered. Local residents were asked to stay indoors and parents urged to take their children to and from school by car. A dozen or so soldiers from a nearby army base joined police and fire officials combing the countryside outside Montevrain. A huntsman, officially designated as a \"wolf catcher,\" who has a specially trained dog, was also part of the search team.

       " Document(page_content='Technology, Place, and the Nonmodern Thesis: Architecture From the Perspective of Regionalism Essay (Critical Writing)\\n\\nThe article Technology, Place, and the Nonmodern Thesis by Moore (2001) examines the features of architectural practices from the perspective of regionalism as a concept that reflects specific trends. The author notes that, despite historical backgrounds and impact, the geographical aspect of technological solutions is more significant (Moore, 2001). The ideas of architects of the late 20th century often failed to address society as a dynamic unity that was regularly transformed, and this omission was associated with ideological beliefs about the specifics of places. Moore (2001), in turn, draws attention to such a concept as 라 sense of place, an approach that focuses on the empirical analysis of geographic locations as factors explaining relevant architectural trends (p. 131). In a historical context, this theory deserves attention since the characteristic nuances of regionalism have always been part of the architecture of different countries and cities. The author gives an example of the era of German socialism and notes the authenticity of forms as a phenomenon that is noticeable at first glance (Moore, 2001). Therefore, regionalism, in its architectural meaning, has stronger impact on the existing trends than ideological or historical preconditions.\\n\\nThe role of technology as an architectural factor is also seen as a significant aspect. Moore (2001) draws a parallel between technological solutions and places and notes that their interaction is one of the main subjects of the study of regionalism in architecture. At the same time, he compares the approaches of modernism and postmodernism and emphasizes that in the latter concept, the concept of place has acquired a more important role than technology (Moore, 2001). As a result, in modern discourse, power relations, supplemented by the visions of regionalism, shape the basis of the architectural idea.\\n\\nReference\\n\\nMoore, S. A. (2001).

       " Document(page_content='Business Ethics Importance and Its Moral Standards Essay\\n\\nEthic is one of the most ancient sciences that has developed as the integrant part of philosophy. Nowadays the problems of the business ethic and the psychological climate in the company are of great importance for its successful functioning. At a time of economic reforms, with the development of private enterprises and new market relations the use of innovative approaches of management becomes actual.\\n\\nAt the same time, there exist a lot of facts of trickery in business relations. The first priority for partners and customers who get into a contact with an organization is a brand confidence, its compliance with the domestic and international laws and its reputation.\\n\\nIn this context, the question of business ethic is very important. It is impossible to create good trading and economic relations without considering moral aspects of business.\\n\\nThe development of any company is possible only under the circumstances of trust relationships between its members. The confidence is based on such notions as social responsibility and good management.\\n\\nThe basis of the business ethic are the moral standards, which rest upon cultural and traditional values. They are the unspoken rules and regulations that include such notions as conscience, accuracy, justice and respect.\\n\\nMy personal belief is that the honesty with customers is one of the key factors that influence the development of any organization. In the modern world under the conditions of the dynamic competitive market, the success of any organization depends upon a customer. There is the unwritten rule that a customer is always right. To some extent, it may be considered as exaggeration, nevertheless the fact remains. It is a customer who ensures a profit of any organization.\\n\\nNo matter whether it is a big multinational corporation or a small private organization- it is a customer for whom an enterprise conducts its activity. The aim of any business organization is the realization of profit. Without a customer there is no profit for an enterprise, without the profit the existence of an enterprise is impossible. It is the universal truth. Every manager in order to be successful should realize this fact, as well as any organization to be competitive should be customer-oriented.\\n\\nIn such a case, the relation between a client and an organization is of great importance. Nowadays many organizations implement new programs aiming to attract customers. They propose different discounts, additional services and even gifts for clients. However, when push comes to shove it turns out that the benefits described by the company are not so obvious. Sometimes a customer is sold a shoddy product, or a contract signed by a customer has hidden dangers.\\n\\nTo my mind, it is a wrong approach to a business. The instantaneous profit is obvious in such a case, but this organization has no future development. The customer, having realized the shadiness of the deal, will never come here again. Moreover, he will talk all his friends and relatives out of dealing with such an unfair organization. The organization loses not only one client. It loses reputation.\\n\\nThe customer should be informed concerning all the peculiarities of the contract as well as the product he is proposed. If he is satisfied with an honest attitude and a service proposed to him, he will be your loyal client. My own belief is that the atmosphere of the mutual confidence is the benefit both for a customer and for an organization.\\n'),\n",

My community has always placed high importance on education both worldly and religiously. My parents being strong believers have always let helped me excel in my studies. They have given me vision and wisdom of what do with my life. My passion for medicine became my lifeline when I understood what medicine means in my community. It is considered a scared profession because of its life-saving capacity. When a child opens his eyes, in our community, he is first taught about his parents and then the Holy leader. My religion teaches me that life is in God's hands, but God has given the ability to men to save and preserve it. As such, the most admirable profession to our Holy leader is being 'doctor'. Since I have been fortunate enough to receive many countless blessings from the Holy leader personally, I vowed in my heart to do everything that pleases Him. My parents particularly my mom is the second tool that shaped my dreams and aspirations. Being the youngest in the family, my parents and sisters have always indulged in my every say. When I was a kid, I loved to play pretend with my sisters where I would be a doctor. At this age, kids mostly pretend to be magicians, scientists and engineers whereas I always pretended to be a doctor. This is probably because I have heard my mom saying that how she wanted to be a doctor. Even though she got the admission in the best medical school, she couldn't go because it was far from home.

       " Document(page_content='I believe that we should not use driverless cars, in my opinion they are an accident wating to happen. The arguments saying we should switch to driverless cars sound far fecthed. The text uses statements such as, \"the cars would use half the fuel of todays cars\", \"they offer more flexibility\", and that \"they are much safer\". These arguments are invalid in many ways that I will explain.\\n\\nThey text says that driverless cars would be cheaper than cars that require a human to handle them, but they are not. Driverless cars aren\\'t even driverless, they still require a human skill to take over when the car cannot comprehend what to do next. Driverless cars would be much more expensive to obtain and operate than a normal car. Driverless cars have many different extremely expensive gadgets needed to even make it semi-automatic, they require position estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an internal motion sensor. A normal human operated vehicle does not require any of those things, so if a person did wish to get a driverless car, they would be paying a substantial amount of money and even more for fuel, to keep up with the parts and technology, and for gas. With a manual car all you have to do is purchase it (for a much smaller amount) and pay gas money and body shop bills should they arise, but still yet, it would be a lot less than the driverless car.\\n\\nThe text also states the driverless cars offer more flexibility than a manual car, this is untrue, they actually offer less. With a manual car, you are the driver and you choose where to go and what to do, with the driverless car you are supposed to tell your GPS where to take you and that\\'s all the input you have. But what if the place you are trying to go is on a road that doesn\\'t show up on the GPS? Now that driverless car is pretty useless. They are much less flexible than a man powered vehicle and much less reliable.\\n\\nLastly, the text states that driverless cars are much safer than manual ones, this is invalid. Their arguments for such a statement are, \"driving in a fun new way\", \"you can have in-car entertainment\", and \"you would be able to text and drive\". These are crazy reasons that a driverless car is safe. First of all, driving doesn\\'t need to be fun, you just need to get from point A to point B. Secondly, there should be no in-car entertainment. Playing games, watching tv, etc. should not be done while driving, because the \"driverless car\" still needs to be operated by a human, this is a deadly distraction. And again, with the texting a driving, this is a lethal distraction that should not be suggested to do, even in a driverless car. If you were to be texting you may not notice your driverless car signalling you to take over, and consequently, you will be in a wreck.\\n\\nIn conclusion, driverless cars should be kept a thing you see in movies, fictional. There are too many risks and dangers to a driverless car and the price would be unaffordable for most. The driverless car is an unthoughtout idea that makes no sense. There are too many problems with the driverless vehicle for it to be reliable and safe, so we need to stick with the manual cars instead. '),\n",

At that instant, everybody stopped, and watched the ball spin past my opponent and land on the sideline. I had done it, I had saved a match point. My adrenaline was pumping, but I composed myself and went on to win the next two points and the match, and to secure the District Championship for my team. My teammates rushed onto the court, and we started celebrating. I was overcome with ecstasy mixed with splendid exhaustion. It's moments such as these that I cherish. When I walk onto a tennis court, I am in an environment where I am perfectly content. On the court, it's not about how well I am performing at school, it's not about how so-and-so is doing. On the court it's about tennis: the purity of the game is what makes it so attractive to me. It offers me a place to be away from all the drama of school and life. The court has long served as a temporary respite from reality. At night, I imagine myself at the grand Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York City, with the bright lights illuminating my play. In the spring, I become an air bender, directing the light, wind-influenced ball through the seasonal gusts. In the summer, I am a ball boy to only the finest of international players. Only when I leave the court, do I truly come back to reality. Because I am passionate about tennis, I have gotten into teaching to help spread my appreciation for the game and its subtle intricacies. Providing an outlet for kids to pick up the sport has strengthened my own love for the game. Tennis has allowed me to gain valuable insight into my own strengths and experience as a competitor.

Essay:\"Mommy, why is the sky blue?\" \"What is air made of?\" Ever since I was a child, I aspired to learn. Learning is what moves me forward; education is what enables me to thrive to my utmost potential. It keeps me constantly on my toes. Each new day provides me with the opportunity to grasp new information. Knowledge is the key to success, and it\\'s essential for growth which is why learning appeals to me most. Learning is a process in life that will never end. As babies, we learn how to distinguish our mothers from other people, read faces, and even mimic them. As we begin to age, we become wiser. Our experiences in life allow us to gain insight, no matter if it is positive or negative. Learning is a way to change yourself and your habits. It\\'s a way to better oneself and others. As I said before, knowledge is essential for growth, not only for us but the world as a whole. In order for the world to augment, research is needed. Research invariably leads to a better understanding, thus inducing improvements or solutions. This goes beyond the traditional coursework. Florida State University gives me the chance to research with the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program. \"Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn.\" Research will allow me to fully understand certain topics and how they improve the community. I am particularly interested in Psychological topics: Why is the number of suicides increasing in female teenagers? Is child obesity a reflection of parental negligence? Does gender affect memory? I believe that anyone can make a difference in this world through learning, research, and discovery. I believe that I can make a difference as an undergraduate student. My parents always guided me in the right direction. They flooded me with advice and lectures of how I should live my life. They taught me what was right and what was wrong, how to work for the things I wanted, and how to treat the people around me. As a young child, most of these lessons went into one ear and left the other, but there is one quote my mother said to me when I was twelve years old that remains with me. \"The beautiful thing about learning is that nobody can take it away from you.\" Learning, ever since then, is something I will treasure for as long as I live.'),\n",

However, recently some people have chosen to take a holiday trip away from home to other provinces or even to other countries on this occasion. What do you think of this trend?***  \\n  \\nMy essay:  \\nWhile celebrating Lunar New Year alongside family and relatives in the hometown has long since been the fundamental tradition in Viet Nam, recent years have witnessed an increasing trend of people travelling far and wide during this special occasion. As far as I know, I do not have any opposition to the phenomenon.  \\n  \\nOn the one hand, taking a holiday trip away does not ruin tradition. By definition, Tet was one period when farmers could rest from their work in the fields, show gratitude to ancestors and Gods, wishing for a great new year with bumper crops. Nowadays, although the country is no longer agriculture-dominated, the meaning of Tet is continued to be preserved, including being the period of relaxation. Therefore, having a journey far away from home is not a disgrace to thousand-year traditions as lots of people complained. The way those travellers try to take care of themselves after a year of stressful working is just a little different, shifting from playing around villages to playing around provinces or countries with the help of technologies.  \\n  \\nOn the other hand, travellers use their own money and stimulate economic - tourism growth without causing real harm to anyone or anything. Moreover, people who bring the whole family along on the holiday or feel homesick on the way are prime evidence for the fact that this trend is neither expanding the generation gap nor damaging family relationships. Thus, \"a day on the road gets you a sieve-worth of wisdom\". Holiday trips are not only recreational but also provide people new experiences and knowledge about local regions. Last but not least, despite the rise in the number of individuals choosing to celebrate Tet faraway, gathering in their hometown is still and will always be the majority so it is quite unreasonable to be anxious about that recent trend.  \\n  \\nIn conclusion, with cultural, economic, individual benefits far outweigh the risks, \"a Tet away from home\" in my opinion is not worth ~~making a fuss~~ worrying about and should be allowed to grow naturally.  \\n  \\nNote: This task is also from a semester/inspection test in a high school for gifted students and we still need to write it like an IELTS task 2.  \\n  \\nI have failed to meet the Task Requirements for words quantity again.......

       " Document(page_content='Marijuana Legalization in California Essay\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nMarijuana is a very controversial substance, which has been a debate in California on whether it should be legalized or not. The substance, which is derived from dried cannabis Sativa or cannabis India, has many uses, including medicinal uses, animal food as well as hemp for rope making. Marijuana happens to be an illegal substance that has the widest use globally. At this point, one wonders why such a substance is termed illegal, yet it seems to have a lot of support from many people. In fact, the usefulness of marijuana as a medicine and rope-making raw material makes it hard to understand why this substance should not be legalized.\\n\\nThe effects that marijuana has on the body are both positive and negative. Since it can decrease intraocular pressure, perhaps it would be wise to consider its use for such a purpose though it leads to reddening of the eyes. The muscle relaxation effect of marijuana also appears to be a positive effect that should be used to argue for its legalization. The negative effects on the body should also be factored in deciding whether to legalize marijuana or not. For instance, an increased heart rate may not be desirable for patients with cardiovascular diseases, not to mention skin sensation effects.\\n\\nMarijuana Legalization Issue\\n\\nCalifornia뗩 proposition that marijuana is legalized for persons aged 21 and older is a sensitive issue. It is hard to ensure that those who are in possession of marijuana do not have more than 28.5 grams. The difficulty in assessing this quantity would imply that people would consume more than 1 oz, more so considering the addictive effects of marijuana. Arguing that marijuana should be legalized and be used in non-public places like personal residential areas does not mean that it would not affect others. Second-hand marijuana smoke may affect family members who live in the same residence with a marijuana smoker.\\n\\nThe control of cannabis is further complicated by arguing that one can grow cannabis in the space of 2.3m2 for personal use. It implies that persons who have more than one private residence may grow marijuana in all the residents, thus exceeding the allowed 25 square feet. This, therefore, means that legalizing marijuana using the above control measures is not an effective way of preventing the adverse effects of the substance.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nWhile it is true that marijuana can raise a substantial amount of revenue from excise tax, sales taxes and save millions of money used in law enforcement of marijuana-related offenses, these benefits may not be worth in the long-run. Given that marijuana has serious health problems, including increased road accidents, as well as increasing the likelihood of use of harder drugs, these benefits may be neutralized later. A large percentage of the population would be jeopardized, thus requiring a lot of money for rehabilitation, not to mention physical and mental impairment that would reduce people뗩 productivity.\\n\\nGiven the several advantages of marijuana use, such as medical use, the use of marijuana should be restricted for such purposes only. Going with the difficulties in controlling marijuana use and the possible harms, I think marijuana should not be legalized in California. However, going with the recent polls (46% for Yes against 54% for No), it is likely that the proposition will be passed in 2012. It is, therefore, important to review the requirements for legalization and implement more stringent rules that will require marijuana to be used only when necessary. Otherwise, our children will be in danger of the harmful direct and indirect effects of marijuana.\\n'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Man in Space  Norm Thagard Descriptive Essay\\n\\nFor many years, man has always been interested in exploring the space. This is evidenced by many fictional scientific stories about the space that have been written. However, he has not made significant success in this endeavor. The greatest success that has been achieved is travelling to the moon in recent decades.\\n\\nMan continues to make space travel attempts through advanced technology with the intention of exploring the space. The first attempt he made to travel to the space which was a joint effort between the Soviet Union and America took place in 1975. This project popularly known as Apollo test project was intended at testing the ability of the two countries to manage future space journeys (Nasa, n.d).\\n\\nRussia and America worked together since 1993 to facilitate space travel by man. Space travel equipments began making their trips to Russian stations in 1994. Norm Thagard was historically recognized as the first American astronaut to reside in Russia.\\n\\nTogether with his seven colleagues, he joined other astronauts from Russia to work in an orbiting laboratory in Russia. This endeavor gave them enough experience that saw the development of space stations with international recognition. In 1998, the stations began developing in-orbit technology which was followed by constant staffing. These developments facilitated space travel greatly (Nasa, n.d).\\n\\nMost of the people who took part in space travel used different technologies such as nuclear propulsion technology. This was a preferable choice of technology because of its reliability and flexibility in long distance space travel. It was also preferable because it was cheaper when compared with other forms of technology such as chemical rockets.\\n\\nDuring space travel, man required certain domestic needs to be met and this made the development of modern technology important. The first technology development in space travel was associated with the Apollo project. This was the first space travel intended at placing man on the moon. This project was an important one and led to the development of different technologies. It expanded the knowledge of man regarding space travel (Nasa, n.d).\\n\\nDuring space travel, man required food since without food there would be no survival. As a result, the first technology used by man to prevent food from going bad during space travel was freeze drying. This technology was initially developed during the Second World War to preserve plasma. It involved freezing the food, a process that removed most of the moisture from it. The foods preserved used this technology included foods like meat, peas and liquids.\\n\\nThe second technology used in space travel was the use of cordless power tools. While in space, astronauts were supposed to carry out different tasks in their quest to gather scientific information. It was therefore not possible for them to gather this information by using traditional or power tools. Traditional tools could not provide much assistance while power tools presented limitations because of their cords. The use of cordless power tools proved to be very useful for the astronauts (Bryson, 2010).\\n\\nThe third type of technology used in space travel was MRI and CAT technologies. The initial space travels were intended at identifying the most suitable grounds to land when man travelled to the moon. For this to be accomplished there was the need to have the right equipment to take space photographs. This technology was used by man during space travel to develop computer aided topography. It was also used to develop magnetic resonance imaging.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nBryson, B. (2010). A Short History Of Nearly Everything. New York: Transworld.\\n\\nNasa. (n.d). Space Shuttle.

Ok, that works our for us, but I've never seen a patron pushed off his table mid-meal before in my life. This should have been my first clue. So we sit, and 10 minutes or so later, the waiter takes our order. Ask him a few questions, almost all of which are answered in a mumble that sounds like yes, it's noodles. Same answer to all questions. Well, we're all tech geeks, so a quick search on our phones manages to DE-mystify most of the menu. Second clue as to the service. 40 minutes later, and 1 salad and 2 soups have appeared so far. There's a bit of hunger going on by now. One of my colleagues is eying the remnants of one of the salads, so we push it over to him. 50 minutes in, and HALF of the table is served. Umm, ok. The remaining 4 of us are patient, and figure we're next. My colleague is now fiddling with the paper wrapper from the chopsticks and I'm afraid he's going to eat it. 60 minutes in, still no food for the remaining 4, and in the meantime we've watched 3 other tables get served. 70 minutes in, I go remind the server that half of our table is missing food. Yeah? It's busy. 75 minutes in, and finally the remaining 4 dishes appear. And my salmon teriyaki is RAW. STONE COLD RAW. 'nuff said. Never again.\"),\n",

Most of these occur very early in pregnancy so it is not really appropriate to call a small mass of cells a fetus. Realizing that this high percentage of pregnancies result in \"natural\\' abortions should give to pause to those who want to ban abortions, They happen. You cannot stop them. Analysis has shown that a high percentage of these miscarriages have abnormalities including chromosomal abnormalities. Something is wrong in the development of the baby and the woman\\'s body terminates the pregnancy. This means the uterus sheds the placental lining and the growing cells. It is like a heavy period. There is no way that the growing cells can be saved. Each monthly menstrual cycle means a pregnancy did not occur. Every man produces millions of sperm every day. It is no wonder that even when a pregnancy starts some of these are false starts.\\', \"Others have mentioned that most miscarriages happen when there is still an embry, not a fetus. A fetus already has its internal organs developed, which happens around 9 weeks after fertilization. At this later stage, most miscarriages happen because the fetus has died for some reason. This can still be because of some genetic defect, but also because of an infection or poisoning, or because of the placenta or umbilical cord are malformed or damaged. For example, it\\'s possible for the umbilical cord to wrap around the fetus so tightly that the blood flow is stopped and the fetus dies. What happens afterwards depends a lot on how big the fetus is. At the beginning, it\\'s still like a heavy period. Towards the end of the pregnancy, the process will be almost the same as giving birth, just to a dead baby.,\" \"I\\'m no expert but this is what I learned from (my wife\\'s) experience last year: Most miscarriages occur very early in a pregnancy, before there is even a proper fetus developed. In these cases, the collection of cells that would have developed into a fetus, which would still be very very small, would be flushed from the body through menstruation, which is indicative of the miscarriage.'),\n",

She went to each student one by one asking what and why do you want to purse your circled career choose. After a few minutes, she bends down slowly next me with a smile as her hand extended out grasping my paper then reading out load my choices to me then asking the famous question of day \"Why do you wish to be an Inventor?\" to my response \"I like how Bill Nye the science guy and the scientist in Scholastic take an idea from their mind then create it into the real world\" still to this day that statement is the core reason why I wish to pursue industrial design. Design is about seeing something as simple as a pen and thinking \"how can I make this better?\" Or \"how can I make something that betters this product?\" Then I start to plan out the design on graphing paper, taking it to the next step of drawing into Inventor Autodesk. Being able to take an idea from your mind that produces into a physical form is a true talent that only so few people can achieve.

The room interior and furniture are in neutral, calming colors  light-yellow, light-blue, beige, and light-green.\\n\\nThe entire floor is carpeted to make it a comfortable sitting area and prevent traumas in case a child trips over and falls. Tables and chairs are exactly the sizes that are appropriate for the age group (3-6), and there are extra cushions for those children who need it for more comfort and better posture. There are also bean bag chairs  ideally, the entire area should predispose children to having a variety of options, whether they want to sit, lean back, or lie down.\\n\\nIt is not easy to predict what disabilities new coming children might have so I would prefer to keep the classroom as resourceful as possible. If a child has fine motor challenges, he or she can be offered adapted scissors and pencil grips. Small toys and stuffed animals should be easy to find and hold at all times, which may be of use for children on the autistic spectrum who need sensory stimming. Children with autism spectrum disorder would also benefit from a schedule with routines so that they know what is coming next and do not stress over uncertainty.\\n\\nWork Cited\\n\\nGargiulo, Richard, and Jennifer L.

       " Document(page_content='Entrepreneurship in the Organic Cosmetics Sphere Essay\\n\\nMelinda Ayre뗩 Article Analysis\\n\\nMelinda Ayre뗩 article provides numerous important tips to a novice entrepreneur in the sphere of organic cosmetics. The article in question is a valuable source as it contains major anticipations of customers, and it also includes strategies used by some competitors in the market.\\n\\nFirst, it is necessary to note that entrepreneurs should be aware of their customers needs and wants. According to the article, customers want to be green, and they want to contribute to making the world better (Ayre 6). Therefore, customers pay attention to the companies operations and their efforts to be green. Clearly, buyers of organic cosmetics are not ready to buy products of poor quality. More so, when buying organic cosmetics, customers want to have a product consisting of purely (or at least, mainly) natural ingredients.\\n\\nOf course, an entrepreneur has to take this into account and make sure that the products produced comply with these requirements. The entrepreneur should also pay attention to his/her company뗩 image, which is crucial in the contemporary world.\\n\\nThe article is a valuable source as it provides solutions to the issues mentioned above. Many companies try to be green and efficient. Of course, when starting a business, it is important to know what strategies are used by competitors. Thus, it is clear that the new company should use renewable energy during production (at least partially). Only natural ingredients can be used. It can be a good idea to donate to some charities and environmental organizations or even participate in a project aimed at making the world better.\\n\\nIn conclusion, it is possible to note that the article in question provides particular points in a checklist of a novice producer/seller of organic cosmetics.\\n\\nLessons from Yasmine Ryan뗩 Article\\n\\nThe article in question provides insights into the industry of organic cosmetics. It is very helpful for novice entrepreneurs who want to start a business in this sphere. First, the article provides information on the operations of one of the pioneers in the field (Ryan 17). This experience is of paramount importance. It is clear that commitment to certain ideas and the ability to maintain the focus on the use of organic ingredients can be seen as crucial for the company뗩 success in the market. Thus, a new business has to provide its customers with high-quality organic products.\\n\\nAnother valuable point provided in the article in question is concerned with standardization. Apparently, standards are essential for any industry and, when it comes to cosmetics, customers are willing to buy products from brands (producers) they trust as these companies comply with particular standards.\\n\\nImportantly, the new business should also comply with certain standards. Clearly, some of these are imposed by the government, and they cannot be enough. There is also an important idea that companies join and form certain standardization bodies as well as regulations. The new business can join one of these formations, and it should comply with the standards developed. This will help enter the market, as customers will see a brand that has certification from a well-known organization. Customers will be more eager to trust the new brand.\\n\\nIn conclusion, it is possible to note that the article in question helps a new entrepreneur to learn more about the successful experience of other producers of organic cosmetics. He/she can also learn about standardization in the industry of organic cosmetics, which is crucial for winning customers trust and entering the market effectively.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nAyre, Melinda.

I just couldn't hold back on the feeling I got just thinking about a car and that freedom I would finally have as a licensed driver. That's when my mom decided how important it was to take care of the planet, and how I should dedicate my time to making this planet all the more greener. I've always been interested in the environment so I though about all the ways I could stay green...with a car that is. What most people don't understand however is the amount of pollution we have in our planet today and how we can do few simple things to avoid it, that's right girls, stop worrying so much about the car and focus more on how you could limit car usage and the advantages of doing so such as avoiding more polution, walking which can actually help you health wise and maybe even saving money on gas;\\xa0 a little green for green.\\n\\nThe amount of polution we have here in dear mother earth is just astonishing. Take Paris for example which happens to have more smog than any other European capital. This kind of polution isn't only bad for the environment however, it also affects us as individuals, polution can not only intoxicate our planet but us as well. Rather than spending a life time figuring out solutions and filling our bodies up with medication we should just be avoiding the problem once and for all, kill it at its source. Avoid using so much car travel that at the end of the day, a bus can take you to the same place and best of all, it comes guilt free.\\n\\nAdding to the whole idea of a healthy lifestyle and environment, try walking, which by the way also prevents car usage and so kills two birds with one stone. If you drop the keys and pick up a pair of running shoes your helping to save the envoironment and at the same time guaranteeing a longer life for yourself. Take Bogota, Colombia for instance and its brilliant idea of Car-free day. Yes, it's exactly as it sounds; a whole day dedicated to reducing car usage, and although they still allow buses and taxis on the streets, regualr every day use cars are 100% banned. Whats the point of this you may ask? Well, it all must begin somewhere, one action creates a chain reaction.\\n\\nOne of an average persons problems here in America involve financial issues, especially now with the economy we have, gas prices aren't the same. How can you avoid a situation like this that may even help you cut down on your daily budget? How about taking other methods of transportation for a change? This way you save extra money for other necessities and at the same time, help clean out our environment by changing up your daily car trips here and there. Although it may not seem like much, a little bit of something can make a huge difference.\\n\\nAll in all, I believe it is important for everyone to undestand how essential it is that we put some thought into our world, especially those eager to drive. Just take a minute out of your eveyday busy schedules and find ways to reduce reuse and recycle to make our world even better for our future generations.    \"),\n",

Many firms have realized that this industry is lucrative given the increase of the number of people looking for healthy foods. In order to understand the attractiveness of this industry, Porters five forces will be used.\\n\\nThe first force is the risk of entry by other potential competitors. This risk is relatively low because most firms these products highly perishable and therefore, prone to high risk if customers are not accessible in time. The bargaining power of the buyers is relatively low because they are convinced that such healthy foods are worth high prices.\\n\\nThey are always willing to pay such high prices. The bargaining power of the suppliers is also low because they are always striving to release these products while they are still fresh. They would try to avoid situation where they stay with the products for long because they can go at serious loss.\\n\\nThe threat of substitutes in this industry is extremely low. It is not easy for the customers to find a perfect replacement for these products. This makes retail grocery industry very attractive. Whole Foods is one of the leading firms in this industry.\\n\\nThe macro environment has a number of factors that affect the retail grocery industry in general, and Whole Foods in specific. The Political environment would dictate ease of doing business in this country. With political stability, the industry will have the needed security to conduct business.\\n\\nThe economic environment may also affect players in this industry. With economic recession, the industry may experience low sales because consumers will have less disposable income. As shown in the case, the economic environment is a main factor that has been considered to affect players in the industry.\\n\\nThe social environment may dictate the nature of products that players in this field may stock. Technology is coming out strongly as another important factor in the external environment. Environmental concern is another important factor. The Green Movement is a clear indication that consumers expect firms to be environmentally friendly.\\n\\nFinally, the legal environment is a factor that must be considered in the external environment. In the internal environment, the financial position of a firm heavily affects its operations. A firm must understand its sales and the net income. The figure below shows the sales and net income of Whole Foods.\\n\\nThe figure above shows the sales made by this firm and the net income from the year 2005 to 2010. From the figures above, it is clear that this firm has been experiencing a steady increase in sales over the years.\\n\\nAlthough the net income was a little unsteady, especially in 2008 and 2009, it started rising again in 2010. The slow rate of income in 2008 and 2009 can be attributed to the 2008/2009 economic recession in the country.\\n\\nBased on the above findings, the main recommendation that the management should consider taking seriously is the need to increase its sales volume by going beyond its current market.\\n\\nThe management should consider moving to other European markets besides United Kingdom. China and India can also make very attractive market for this firm given the huge population they have. This will help in increasing their net income.\\n'),\n",

To enforce his blockade, Napoleon launched an invasion of Russia in the summer of 1812. The resulting campaign witnessed the catastrophic collapse of the Grand Army, forcing the French to retreat, as well as leading to the widespread destruction of Russian lands and cities. In 1813, Prussia and Austria joined Russian forces in a Sixth Coalition against France. A chaotic military campaign in Central Europe eventually culminated in a large Allied army defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Leipzig in October. The next year, the Allies invaded France and captured Paris, forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April 1814. He was exiled to the island of Elba. The Bourbons were restored to power and the French lost most of the territories that they had conquered since the Revolution. However, Napoleon escaped from Elba in February 1815 and took control of the government once again. The Allies responded by forming a Seventh Coalition, which ultimately defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in June. The Royal Navy then thwarted his planned escape to the United States in July, so he surrendered to the British after running out of other options. The British exiled him to the remote island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic. His death in 1821 at the age of 51 was received with shock and grief throughout Europe. In 1840, a million people witnessed his remains returning to Paris, where they still reside at Les Invalides.'),\n",

When I need advice I ask multiple people so I can get everyones opinion. When I get multiple peoples advice I choose one that will be best for me. What I\\'m trying to say is that asking for more advice can be useful.\\n\\nOne reason why I think asking for multiple advice is good, and helpful because people could be going through rough times. People ask for advice sometimes because maybe they have family problems, and they need help so they go ask people for advice. When you need advice you don\\'t have to ask one of your family members, you can ask a teacher you trust, your counselor, or your friends. Out of all the advice you get you can choose one advice that you think could help you the most or you can use all the advice people gave you and try them to see if the advice would help. There can be many different reasons why poeple ask for several of advice.\\n\\nSecond reason of why I think asking for multiple advice is good. Another reason why people ask for advice is because they could be making a club, and they might not know what to do. Club members can put up posters, and ask people to write their advice or opinions on what they should do to make the club better, and more interesting. All the advice they will get is going to help them make the club better and they could get more members added to their club. When you ask for advice from people their advice can make things better.\\n\\nMy third reason is, sometimes you are so nervous for a test so you go ask for advice from people. When you want advice for a test you can go to your teacher and ask them for advice, or you can also ask other kids that have took the test before and they can give you some good advice since they took the test already. Advice can really help you if you are nervous. When you are nervous and people are giving you some advice their advice can help you calm down. Sometimes you can also give yourself some adviceb by saying to yourself \"you got this\" or \"you are going to do good on this test\".\\n\\nI say that asking multiple people for advice is important. It\\'s important because all the advice people give you can help you through out the day.

TL;DR it\\'s just like any other bill you neglect to pay, it goes up and gets passed around. Edit: This is all assuming no effort is made to pay the debt.,It sounds to me like you are talking about a judgment. As an example, someone breaks a lease and the landlord then gets a judgment against the tenant for 3,000. In my state, they normally add 8 and 34 interest to the judgment, simple interest (it doesn\\'t compound - no interest on interest). It is the landlord\\'s job to collect the judgment. First, you record the judgment in the county where the debtor resides. By recording the judgment a lien is created on all the tenantdebtor\\'s real estate in the county. If the debtor tries to sell any real estate, it is sold subject to the lien of the creditorlandlord. So, the bank will not loan money to the buyer of the property unless the lien is paid off. So, at closing the creditor is issued a check for the value of the property. Second, the landlordcreditor can foreclose on the \"real\" property themselves. Sue the debtor again to force the sale of the property. Third, the creditor can send the Sheriff to the debtor\\'s home to \"execute\" on the judgment. This is where the Sheriff shows up with the judgment and then takes stuff to be sold to pay off the judgment. Fourth, if the debtor has no property to execute against, then, in my state the creditor can garnish the debtor\\'s wages (garnishing is where the a third-party is sued because they hold property that shouldwill be given to the debtor). The creditor can also garnish a bank account or other debtor property that is held by another. IANAL, and especially not your lawyer. If there is a debt out there you cannot pay, and you are in the US, then you should talk to a bankruptcy lawyer ASAP. Good luck and good night.\\', \"A lot of people in the criminal justice system are trying to get rid of LFOs (legal financial obligations) for poor people.

Here is a good breakdown of the issue: URL0,\" \"A lot of fines brought down by municipalities and other governmental organizations that are a result of laws being broken can easily result in a person ending up in prison due to nonpayment of that fine.

In many cases the prison term costs the state more than the fine in the first place, and a prison term disenfranchises the person, making it even harder for them to find work and pay off the fine, causing a negative feedback loop that results in increased incarceration, systemic poverty and a higher likelihood of further illegal actions (theft, etc.) just to make ends meet.

       " Document(page_content=\"I used to work here in the Forum Shops and was one of those anticipating for Carmine's to open and finally got to try them out last week. I came here with a party of 11 to celebrate my aunt's birthday. I must say my aunt and her family are from NY and have eaten at the Carmine's there, so the expectations were set pretty high. I do love the inside of the place especially how the high raised ceilings have all sorts of pictures hanging on the walls. If only the restaurant was in a stand alone building then it would truly give that Manhattan feel. Before anything was served we noticed that the plates were at the end of the table, my aunt expected the server to place each plate in front of us because that's what the server did in NY. It didn't happen, so I guess here it's more of a self serve concept. My beverage of choice was the strawberry lemonade since another review mentioned how good and tart it was. She was right I did enjoy the tartness (tasted similar to Red Robbin's Freckled Lemonade), too bad it's not free refill because I sure did finish that drink before the food was served. So here is the break down of the food: Carmine's salad- I liked all the additional toppings in this salad like berries, nuts, and salami if I remember correctly. We had 2 salads and assumed they were the same because they looked very similar. After tasting both we realized the other one was a mixed green salad. I prefer Carmine's salad and say it's worth the 3 difference. Calamari- pretty standard, wasn't too greasy and the breading was like how I've had it at other Italian restaurants. Zuppa Di Clams (white) - I am not a fan of clams but my brother convinced me to try the last piece and I was pleasantly surprised. If you enjoy clams I definitely would recommend this dish, pretty delicious I must say. The sauce for the clams was so good we saved it to put on our pasta. Broiled porterhouse steak- this was really delicious and I thought it was perfectly cooked with various pieces being rare and medium (refer to the picture). One of the better cuts of steak I've had from a restaurant. Warning this is pricey, costing 80. Chicken Scarpariello- I read from another review recommending this dish and when we ordered it the server said they were out?! I was shocked at first because I've never heard of a chicken dish running out at a restaurant. Thankfully she came back and said they still had it. It was cooked in a buttery sauce, probably my favorite dish of the night and reasonably price. I will definitely order this the next time I come back. There was a pasta dish we ordered but I can't remember what the name was. Next time I come, I'll also order the Rigatoni Broccoli as recommended by another yelper. According to my aunt and her husband the food was a little on the salty side, but still a good quality in comparison to the one in NY. However the service was lacking. I really want to come back but it probably won't be any time soon. This place was pricey so I'll have to find a special occasion to come here for.\"),\n",

I think so because their phone wont be ringing or distracting them at school. They would probably be texting someone during class and wouldn't be listening to the teachers and wont be learning anything. The point of coming to school is to learn and gain knowledge, not text and socialize. If they didn't have any phones, then they would be listening to the teachers and get a better education. Then the teachers wont be just wasting their time talking to them selves.\\n\\nAlso no phones allowed would most likely bring students better grades. I think this because they wont have their phone to play with and would learn something as i said in paragraph two. They would know the answers to tests and know how to do there homework. which is over all a better grade.\\n\\nThis is a better choice then policy 1 because they will still be able to have there phone and will either sneak it into class and that will be just the same as having there phone in class. Or they might be talking to someone during their free time in the library through the phone making noise causing a distraction to someone else in the library that is trying to study for a quiz, and now they cant because someone is distracting that person.\\n\\nSo TEACHER_NAME\\n\\ni think policy 2 would be the best choice.

I usually get the bernaise sliders but this time I wanted to try something new. I tried the monte cristo but it wasnt good at all here. im surprised its even on the menu. We got a few other things and it was just okay. Service wasnt the greatest, it was very slow, but the real reason this place gets a 1 star is because of the manager. I was meeting a few friends there. 1 of them was there when I arrived and we got the table, the other came in a bit and we all ordered. The last person was just coming to meet up and she arrived either close to closing time or maybe a little bit after closing. But we were still eating. She wasnt going to eat or anything, just meet up with us and hang out till we were done. My friend went to get her and the manager came up to us and said something like, you cant do that, we're closed. We told him that she wasnt ordering anything and that she was just meeting with us until we were done eating. He said a few other words and while im eating this horrible monte cristo im thinking, are you serious right now?? Shes not ordering anything, we are all together, we are gonna finish up eating and then we are all leaving together. Does he expect her to just sit outside and wait for us??

Although the two works have a different scope of content  one encompasses the religions of the entire world concerning contemporary values, and the other focuses on western traditions  both of them dedicate significant parts to the study and analysis of Christianity in the modern world.\\n\\nIn his book The World뗩 Religions, Huston Smith looks at the traditions of Christianity in the context of the contemporary world, its principles, and values. Although the description of Christianity is selective, it is performed in a very comprehensive and eloquent manner focusing on the points relevant and important in the world of nowadays.\\n\\nThe author contemplates the principles, prospects, and contributions into the history of the world뗩 largest faith. His interpretation of the shared faith in Christianity before it separated into Orthodox, Catholic, and Protestant Churches is considered to be a very advanced and modern interpretation of this period of Christianity.\\n\\nNot all of the statements made by Smith, however, could be regarded as a progressive point of view. His work implies that the future of Christianity  and any religion  is dependent upon taming the science and controlling its progress (Cousineau, 2003).\\n\\nAdditionally, Smith also acts as an opponent of the evangelical churches for their interpretation of the Bible and involvement in politics.\\n\\nFinally, his religious views combine both liberal attitude to the Bible and other religions and quite an orthodox opinion that Jesus Christ was 랁ully God and fully man.\\n\\nIn her book Living Religions: Western Traditions, Mary Pat Fisher also devotes a substantial part to the aspects of Christianity, its origins, central teaching, and practices in the context of the Western world. These issues are discussed concerning common experiences of human existence: love, evil, compassion, wisdom, death, etc.\\n\\nThe work is based on the understanding of the doctrines of the largest religions of the world, including Christianity. Additionally, Mary Pat Fisher focuses on how the religions and their doctrines intertwine in contemporary Western society, and how they were influenced by the non-religious world, pop culture, and scientific progress.\\n\\nThe author highlights that although the general belief is that the popularity of Christian religion is now decreasing, the future of today뗩 Western society still depends and in many ways is predetermined by the development and progress of the Christian religion.\\n\\nOverall, both authors are faithful Christian believers and their beliefs find their reflection in their works.

When we hear that we are going to work alone it sounds good but not for all. It should be great for those people who don't have the capacity to work with others. Even you do not believe it, working in group is feature that no all humans have it. Why I think like that? because working with other people we help us to learn different types of job, we can able to work in others areas with others folks, we can meet amazing people.\\n\\nTo begin with, working in group can help us to learn different types of job. I have my own experience with this. When I started my first job I didn't learn enough. I worked in a hotel and people there liked to work alone. Sometimes I didn't know how to do something and I immediately asked but those workers didn't like to teach others, and they said you should learn by yourself. Obviosly I didn't agree with them and I started to find different job where I could learn more. Working alone was the most diffucult job I've ever had. I could't learn from others because they didn't give me the opportunity to do it. Now I got experience from others how to work in restaurant, markets or shopping centers. I think you will learn hundred percentage better if you are learning from others. However, some people claim that work alone is more beneficial to concentrate, but I insist that work with someone else with leave you more knowledge than work alone.\\n\\nTo continue, if we worked before in commuties or in group we are able to work in different areas of work and also work with different folks, it will be easier for us. When we are looking for a job in our interview the boss or managers will always ask if we have problem to work with others. They ask this questions because they want to be sure that we will work in different places and we will interact with the other employees. If we anwser NO, I'm really sure that we won't get job soon. If we are willing to learn and work together as a team we'll have success in every job that we get. If we change of jobs is because we are looking for something better, and we will achieve working in different areas learning diffrente jobs, acquiring experience from others, showing that we are able to work with others, all these can be beneficial for us when we are looking for job.\\n\\nIn addition, we can meet amazing people working in group. When we work with others we are making friends. My mom found her best friend Generic_Name in her job. They have eleven years with this beutiful friendship. Everyone needs a friend that can help, teach and learn with you. Think about it, there are more benefits working with someone else than working alone. Even though some people say that working in group is more complicated because you will find people who don't want to teach how to work or it can be distracting for you. I feel sure that there are more people good than bad and also if you know your work, you know what to do in your job there aren't people or thing distracting for job. We should be responsable with our job this is an important thing that you shouldn't forget. In schools, in works or in the street we'll find amazing people who will help to improve our skill as workers or as humans being.\\n\\nTo sum up, working in group will help us to find better jobs, to learn new thing, to interact with different people. Here in The United States we will find many jobs, we are able to learn many thing and also to interact with different people from different countries. Do not reject the opportunities to grow and accomplish your dreams. If some day you have the chance to teach others, do it with patience as a proffesional worker and keep in your mind that two heads think better than one.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Kristen Monroe뗩 Views on Humanity During a War Essay\\n\\nPeople are able to act humanely during the war by simply being able to understand that we are all created equally. More so, during the war, there is the thought that if you kill someone, they will forever be engraved in your mind, and they will be able to haunt you later on. Although Monroe states that all human beings have the capacity to be good or evil at any given time, they are still controlled by the subconscious, and that is what determines what role an individual plays during a war or a genocide.\\n\\nMonroe also compares the ability to retain humanity during the war with the ability to be able to help a stranger. It emerges from the feeling that the world is generally a better place and that life in itself should not be taken away since it is a gift. Thus, individuals who tend to be humane during the war are those ones who take it as a responsibility to trust the other person not to do them any harm and, in the process, give them the privilege of life.\\n\\nThe strategies Monroe뗩 characters use to cope with trauma are being open and sharing with their friends. Another strategy is registering for therapy where they can share their experiences with other people who have gone through the same and be able to deal with their trauma.\\n\\nThe time I experienced a traumatic event was around five years ago when I was involved in a fatal road accident in which I was the driver. My vehicle, which was a Toyota Caldina, swayed off the road since it was raining, and an oncoming bus had all its full lights on.\\n\\nThis blurred my vision, and in the process, I was unable to maintain the vehicle on the road. The car skid on the road and overturned only for it to settle in a culvert. In the car was my uncle, aunt, and baby Stephan, who is my cousin. Although they sustained minor injuries, the car was badly damaged, and I was left traumatized more so since I had not finished paying for the car.\\n\\nIt was a tough experience to the stomach, but I had a supportive family. I signed up for a therapy session where I was able to share my experiences with other people like me who had undergone traumatic experiences. I was able to accept that I should have been more careful, and thus all the anger I felt towards the bus driver vanished.\\n\\nIn relation to the texts provided, dealing with trauma can be difficult and gruel some, especially if an individual keeps on blaming someone else for what may have taken place. Thus, the strategies I used worked since I was able to accept my role in what happened, and in the process, the stress became minimal. The text literature concurs with the strategies I applied since it recommends the use of social and emotional support as well as being able to cherish the memories of the event through active processing. This is one of the most successful methods as it enables soldiers coming from war to be able to deal with trauma.\\n\\nThe solutions to dealing with trauma provided by psychologists are in sync with the ones provided in the text. Psychologists suggest that when one is faced with the trauma they should try to avoid stimulants such as alcohol or coffee in an effort to forget the memories they have, but instead, they should embrace their memories and share with others. Furthermore, they also advise such people to take part in group activities such as exercises and jogging so as to reduce periods of loneliness. Prayer, meditation, a balanced diet, and enough sleep are also other useful remedies outlined by psychologists.\\n'),\n",

People talk about how bad things are in this country but in reality there are some people who are forced to walk miles everyday just to get some water. This is why I am eager to build my career around studying laws, foreign policy, and, politics. I value the College of Human Ecology because there are many aspects that need to be analyzed while dealing with delicate issues that arise when injustice occurs. In order to solve these problems, I need this knowledge to approach the situation in the best way possible. Cornell University will give me the knowledge I need to go forward in my career. At The College of Human Ecology, majors are designed and organized by social topics and themes which makes education more than just reading a textbook. My intended major is Policy Analysis and Management with a minor in French. Studying at this institution would widen my perspective on issues around the world. In my career these skills will allow me to better understand the social, economical, and cultural aspects before jumping to any conclusions or making a wrong and uninformed decision. I thought long and hard about what I want to do in life. I'm compelled to join this type of work. Furthermore, I feel a great deal of obligation to this type of work. Furthermore, I can relate to these issues of poverty because I have witnessed them first hand. Furthermore, I spend much of summer in my mother's native land, Ecuador.

There are people walking around with no shoes who are forced to live under lean-huts made of cardboard and other debris. No one is helping these people not even the Ecuadorian government. I feel the need to help these people, but this isn't even the worst compared to poverty in other countries. Acceptance into Cornell University would open many doors for me. The research and analysis skills that I'll attain will serve me for the rest of my life. The College of Human Ecology will test me and push me to my fullest potential.

I\\'ve always enjoyed building things. Thus, no one was surprised when I decided to apply to university for mechanical engineering. My interest in mechanical engineering is actually an old one. It first began at the age of seven when I first accompanied my father, also an engineer, to work. He showed me all the different water jets, engines, pistons and machinery. Although I wasn\\'t old enough to fully comprehend what I saw, I was nevertheless dumbfounded by it. Ever since that day I have become determined to pursue a career in mechanical engineering. I would never have come this far without the help of my father. He is truly the most influential character in my life; my source of motivation and help. Not only was he the first to introduce me to mechanical engineering, but he has continued to inspire me throughout all these. Moreover,; he taught me how to adapt to both the changes and competition that I will face due to the eventual shift in my career from an amateur to a professional. In addition, he showed me how to reach what others expect from me and exceed these expectations if possible. He also taught me to never give up and that no matter how hard achieving something may look like; the juice will always be worth the squeeze. Besides all these things he helped me acquire a summer job as a mechanic in training which gave me the opportunity to interact with people and real life work for the first time. Only through combining his valuable teaching with his guidance and advice did I manage to succeed in my job and win the \"Best Apprentice\" award and a job offer for the following year.

       " Document(page_content='Status of Women and Free African Americans Essay\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n 1. Introduction\\n 2. Main Discussion\\n 3. Conclusion\\n 4. References\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nTo begin with, it is necessary to emphasize that the period of American independence was featured with the absence of rights for women and African Americans. They did not have even basic rights stipulated. It is claimed that even revolution did not guarantee equal rights to every American. However, the situation started changing in the 19 th century with the so-called market revolution. Forner (2005) emphasizes that  many white Americans could have look forward to a life of economic accumulation and individual advancement but large numbers of free blacks experience downward mobility. It is worth noting that free blacks from the north were the last group to experience indentured servitude since the terms of emancipation required children of slave mothers to work for their masters before being freed.렢\n\\nMain Discussion\\n\\nThe market revolution was intended to improve the financial position of African Americans and it is also regarded as the confirmation that African Americans did not have any financial and social opportunities at that time. Originally, these were not only the southerners who discriminated against the African Americans. The northerners were also denying the rights and opportunities for blacks and white women, however, on the other hand, some influential northerners supported emancipation. Anyway, according to Forner (2005)  the earlier ideology of republican motherhood which allowed women a kind of public roles as mothers of future citizens evolved subtly into the mid-nineteenth century as the cult of domesticity. As more men were leaving the home for work women did exercise considerable power over personal affairs within the family. The rapid decline in the American birthrate during the nineteenth century cannot be explained except by the conscious decision of millions of women to limit the number of children they bore. The idea of a domestic city minimized even women뗩 indirect participation in the outside world. To both genders, freedom meant fulfilling their respective inborn qualities.\\n\\nMen were regarded as rational, hostile, and dominant, while women were nurturing, selfless, ruled by their emotions and thus they were less fitting for public life. Men moved freely between public and private life spheres while women were supposed to remain cloistered in the private realm of the family. (Forner, 2005). As for nowadays, it should be stated that the treatment towards men and women stayed the same, however, there are much more exceptions from this rule nowadays. It emphasizes the development of the legislative base, which promotes social rights and financial opportunities for women. The same is with the blacks: they have much more opportunities, they have affirmative action (which is often called reverse discrimination), and they have an opportunity to lead the corporation, and now even to rule the country. It was impossible at least 50 years ago. It may seem that women at this time have all the necessary freedoms but however, some consider that it is rather a false perception. It is explained by the fact that women are still discriminated against and considered to be weaker than men.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nIn conclusion, it is necessary to emphasize that the market revolution offered numerous opportunities for African Americans and white women, though it offered opportunities that caused the essential division in the already divided community.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nFoner, E.

       " Document(page_content='The Language of Art Essay\\n\\nJohn Berger proposes that, in the contemporary setting, images are not always interpreted on the basis of their explicit denotation but the often-slanted viewpoints of the audience. He stated, The way we see things is affected by what we know or believe (8). The implication is that the language of images in art is grounded on the underlying interactions between an individual뗩 perception of information, and their sociological bias.\\n\\nIn exploring this language, Berger also comments on technological developments and their impact on contemporary artistic interpretation. Additionally, he criticizes current perceptions of the arts because of their fascination with 랊riginals which surpasses the understanding of the works themselves. This problem is further escalated because technology can reproduce numerous copies of an original work, which ultimately devalues it.\\n\\nHow the Language is used to Interpret Art\\n\\nThe language of art has spawned divergent interpretations of various works, but in many cases, those that claim to appreciate art are ignorant of its real value or meaning. Berger argues that in many instances, art lovers, ranging from seasoned patrons to amateurs tend to read art based on its rarity rather than the intrinsic value. For example, it is common to find people crowding around a rare piece like the Mona Lisa.\\n\\nHowever, their interpretation of the experience is not based on the picture뗩 history or its underlying meaning, but merely the fact that they saw an original (Berger 21). Evidently, the writer feels that peoples material interest in art waters down its significance and misuse the language of art. This notion resonates with his next argument that, when one looks at art without considering the historical and perhaps personal factors that motivated it, they can easily misread it.\\n\\nFor example, Van Gogh뗩, Wheatfield with Crows, invokes serenity in many viewers. Nevertheless, this is ironic considering that it was the last thing he painted before committing suicide (Berger 21). Evidently, the writer뗩 concern for simplicity and even ignorance with which people often approach art is justified.\\n\\nExample of a Powerful Image and Reflection\\n\\nNot even contemporary works have been spared misinterpretation, which often replaces their artistic value with a commercial one. For example, the image of Che Guevara, the Cuban 랁reedom fighter, has become synonymous with freedom struggle and human rights campaigns world over.\\n\\nConversely, the said hero was in many ways a terrorist and by his own admission carried out executions of those who did not share his ideology. Irrespective of this, people interpret his iconic image in millions of T-shirts (for sale), and art galleries as a symbol of peace and equality. This demonstrates how insignificant the intrinsic meaning and value of art have become. As a designer, I observe and create numerous images, but Berger뗩 book has forced me to reconsider my sometimes non-critical perception of art.\\n\\nReflecting on his sentiments, I realize that art is far greater than the canvas, on which it exists or its overt significance. Every artwork ought to be valued by, not only rarity or abundance but also the covert meaning and movement behind it. The fact that art loses value after duplication is a testament to the inverted priorities both within and without the art world.\\n\\nHowever, if the language of art is applied correctly, art can be primarily interpreted as a product of an artist뗩 imagination, observation, and reflective experience. From this viewpoint, I must also re-examine the pieces that I interact with daily and recalibrate my mental schemas about them. This way, I can do justice to both the creations and the creators by seeing past, ascribed commercial value, and popular assumptions.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nBerger, John. Ways of seeing . Vol. 1.

       " Document(page_content='Excel Software Utilization in Business Setting Essay\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n 1. Introduction\\n 2. Excel application in a business setting\\n 3. Conclusion\\n 4. References\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nMicrosoft Excel, which is a commercial spreadsheet, distributed by Microsoft is unarguably one of the most important computer software programs used by many businesses across the globe. The program dominates the spreadsheet product industry with an estimated 90% market share. Since 1987 spreadsheets have become pervasive and an effective tool for comparative data analysis and have continuously been modified; Excel 2007 has the capacity for 1 million rows and 16million columns spreadsheets. It is worth noticing from the past trends that a lot of modifications are underway, and the business community will still have a lot to smile about. (Graves, 2007)\\n\\nExcel application in a business setting\\n\\nOne of the most important uses of Excel to a businessman is in keeping and managing customers data. Millyard (2012) writes that the business owner does not have to plan on how the table should look like because the existing layout allows one to create data with ease, besides being in a position to sort and filter the listing like a database. It is also possible to add fields in the sheet as they come without interfering with the existing data. Excel makes it easier for businesses to create basic employee and resource schedules. According to Simo Tech (2012), business owners can create worksheets showing the time every employee should be at work. Excel even makes it possible for various departments within the organization to work from the same resource sheet.\\n\\nIn (Graves, 2007) article, Excel has simplified various accounting work within the businesses. Excel has inbuilt functions and formulas that can help in managing data and records efficiently. These functions can also help in the analysis of data, and through the creation of comprehensive drop-down boxes, the likelihood of errors during data entries will be reduced. The inbuilt pivot tables also allow for a detailed analysis of stock movement and the inventory level in a business. The sheet which is available in Excel makes it easier to record all the business revenues and expenditures. Excel has a function called goal to seek which makes it easier for the task to be completed. Cooperate budgeting which is also fundamental in business accounting can be done easily when Excel is applied. Most companies have in the recent past insisted on the use of Excel for budgeting despite calls by suppliers of Business Management systems not to use Excel as their budgeting tool. (Microsoft Excel 2010)\\n\\nExcel makes it easier to track product sales on a weekly and a monthly basis. This makes it easier for the business to compare the progress time and spot the trends which will enhance their ability to make future projections by applying regression analysis. Every business venture is interested in tracking business sales along with other relevant expenses which makes it easier to see the return on investments for each input.

How do you know that your reality isn\\'t just one side of the coin?\" I\\'m going to have an aneurysm dealing with these two. These men appeared out of the blue at the summit of my perfect plateau overlooking the city. One wore a comically patchwork suit, while the other wore a rather nice black italian tux. Upon seeing my shock, they deduced the time of day, day, month, year, and geographical location. I thought it would be more impressive than simply looking at their watches. The black tux spoke of utopian paradise, peace, FTL, and many other fantastic things that I really had a hard time grasping. The comical one spoke of death, plagues, the end of the world, no mention of the second-coming, and the looming black hole that would soon be seen in the sol system. The Political situation of the world was either anarchy or unified world government. But it seemed that through talking to them I understood something perfectly clear...... Both realities existed. It wasn\\'t so much as both lying but both telling the truth. What was a perfect world to one was hell for another. What one could perceive as anarchy was in fact world peace. In a way, it made sense. That nothing in this world is truly perfect or truly hell but a cross between the two. In having \"anarchy\" but world peace, would mean that the governments were united and that the only unrest came from the people. So no wars but there were riots. Technology meant people could be cured of everything, the problem is..... super viruses and bacterial adaptation meant every month or so a new pathogen would decimate a group of people or at least cause 10 million people to be in the hospital for a month. They were very little deaths but constant suffering. \"So is there anything I should know about the future that might help me today?\" \"Nope, have a nice day. We\\'re just here on Holiday, enjoy your evening!\" That even if things were perfect or if things were hell. I should be happy for this world I\\'m in.

The ended up having exactly what we were looking for. The price was very good and so we bought it and set delivery. Afterwards I read the reviews of this place, and normally I would have avoided it if I had read the reviews before I went in. However, after working with them myself I have very little complaints. Let me say, if you are expecting five star service then this is not your place. You get what you pay for. If you want to get five star service you have to pay for it. This is a low price furniture store. The people in store are very friendly and most of the people I dealt with were super nice and helpful. Especially the delivery people. I think the biggest issue is that previous reviewers are not asking the right questions before they buy. So below are a few pointers on that. Before that I will say I got what I ordered, in good condition, and delivered when they said it would be. So I give them 3.5 stars rounding up to four for the friendly service. Pointers First you must understand, unlike RC Willey and your larger companies, stores like this do not really have a warehouse of furniture. They have to rely on the manufacturer to have it in their warehouse in California and get it to them in time for delivery. With the above said, you should ALWAYS ask if the product is in stock in the manufacturer's warehouse (they can check this fairly easily. If it is then you will definitely receive it very quickly. If not, be prepared to wait a while, because they cannot get it until the manufacturer provides it. If you do the above you will have a much better experience with stores such as this one. I honestly would not recommend purchasing unless they do not have it in stock though. It could cause a long wait and much stress on your part.\"),\n",

I don\\'t believe 4th quarter comebacks justify Tebow\\'s believers, not in the games he played where he lead a clearly superior Denver team into a 4th-quarter deficit. He did have a playoff win. I\\'m convinced I personally would have been able to beat a banged-up steelers team with the surrounding cast Tebow had. I think Kyle Orton was the better QB the whole time, and he now backs up Tony \"I can\\'t even throw a temper tantrum without it turning into a pick-6\" Romo. Mark Sanchez was the obvious choice in New York. Tebow clearly couldn\\'t beat out the Buttfumbler for a starting job, and couldn\\'t beat out Greg McElroy for the backup job. His tryout with New England was a good move by the front office to draw attention away from the depleted receiving corps, Aaron Hernandez murder trial, and the possibility the Pats might not win the division for the second time in 10 years. After working out with numerous QB gurus, under several head coaches, being mentored by good QBs, and playing football at a competitive level for over a decade, Tebow knows his strengths and weaknesses. Throwing a football isn\\'t something he can consistently do well at the NFL level, even in an emergency backupspecial teams situation. My assessment of his skill has absolutely nothing to do with his faith and evangelism, which I find to be off-putting and unprofessional. This has nothing to do with his being named \"Most Influential Athlete\" by Forbes. This only slightly has to do with the media circus that surrounds him, and the die-hard Tebow fans that seem to value his beliefs over his W\\'s and L\\'s.'),\n",

The Role of the UNHCR in Refugee Protection in the Middle East Essay\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nIn this article, the author discusses the role of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the Middle East, especially following the recent escape of Iraqis and Syrians into other neighboring countries in the Arab world. The author examines whether the role of these agencies concerning refugees in the Middle East is about human rights, needs, or they are simply seeking to offer assistance to the affected individuals. Ultimately, the author seeks to understand the concept of protection as defined by the UNHCR and how such definition plays out in the context of Syrian and Iraqis refugees in the Middle East.\\n\\nAnalysis\\n\\nThe main point that Stevens raises in this article is the examination of 랎he meaning of 딿rotection as applied by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in its policy in the Middle East, with particular reference to Jordan and Lebanon (264). The author argues that the definition of international protection as adopted by the UNHCR is confusing, especially when applied to refugees from Syria and Iraq in various Arab nations.\\n\\nThe main theoretical issues that arise from this article include the role of different international agencies, such as UNHCR and various NGOs in addressing the issue of refugees around the world. Additionally, the theoretical issues on relief and protection of human rights arise in this reading. Some of the questions that arise in this article include  Does the definition and interpretation of 랄nternational protection of refugees by the UNHCR impede or promote the governments willingness to help Syrian and Iraqi refugees in the Arab world? Is the rights-based approach towards refugees an effective and practical tool?\\n\\nI agree with the author that the definition of 랋rotection of refugees by the UNHCR according to the rights-based approach is narrow and it does not cover the reality of what happens on the ground, especially in the context of Syrian and Iraqi refugees in the Middle East. This reading challenges the commonly held view that there should be a one-size-fits-all approach when addressing the problem of refugees.\\n'),\n",

As Rhett Butler and Scarlett O\\'Hara, or Heathcliff and Catherine of Withering Heights will tell you, sometimes what seems like the perfect match just isn\\'t really all that perfect. This is true, as well, in the case of my relationship with\" \". As a high school student, I was always the girl neck-deep in countless extracurricular activities. Alienated by what I viewed as high school\\'s prescriptive curriculum and the ways it fosters competition rather than knowledge, I tried to intellectually stimulate myself outside of school instead. But as I entered\" \", on the cusp of my eighteenth birthday, I realized that I knew nothing, and I quickly made the resolution to learn everything. I thrived on the flexibility of a collegiate curriculum, in which I was able to exert agency in the courses I chose to take, and in which my opinion was valued. I could be the dissenting voice, the endless skeptic or the unwavering defendant of a text, and this was welcomed. If I began my college career naive and willing, I am transferring institutions emboldened and invigorated. And though\" \" has contributed immensely to my maturation, I feel that I have reached the limits of what\" \" can provide me. I partially chose to attend\" \" due to its politics program\\'s emphasis upon legal studies and American politics. However, as I have taken courses and interacted with my professors, I now realize that my intellectual interests are in fact more geared toward political theory and the comparative politics of postcolonial nations, notably those in Latin America and the Middle East. The limited course offerings in my areas of interest limit not only what courses I can enroll in, but the opportunities to find professors who share my academic curiosities. My desired course of study would be better expressed within a political science program more balanced in its course offerings, one that is concerned with empirically and theoretically situating the contemporary condition of the Global South. In transferring, I want to find myself inspired, not only by the texts I read, or by the professors that teach me, but by the student who sits beside me. I want the fervent debate and discussion that takes place within the confines of the classroom to be contiguous with the activism of the college campus at large. Though my peers at\" \" are intelligent, I have found them to be less engaged in the sorts of intellectual quandaries that I often find myself embroiled in. Of course, I do not aspire to be lumped together with students who share all of my own interests, but I hope to immerse myself in a student body who cares just as deeply as I do, who is overflowed with their own sense of urgency to do something and to leave one\\'s mark upon the world we live in.

What exactly is the professor trying to look for in this writing experiment. It can't be the simple fact to see if a person is capable of typing for 20 minutes.

Its first of six daily services from Grosmont to Pickering started at 09:30 GMT with stops at Goathland, Newtondale and Levisham on route. A total of 8,500 tickets were purchased for the sold-out locomotive service, which runs until 20 March.

All 8,500 tickets went on sale on 26 October last year and were sold out by Christmas, they added. NYMR declined to disclose how much money it had made from the sales, but said some of the funds would pay for the \"upkeep\" of its heritage line. General Manager Chris Price said: \"We\\'re understandably incredibly excited about Flying Scotsman arriving and I\\'m sure that many others will be too, although we do urge anyone wanting to take photographs to do so from a safe distance and refrain from straying onto the railway itself. \"After recent events, British Transport Police has confirmed that if people are seen trespassing on the tracks, they risk being brought before the courts, a fine of PS1,000 and a criminal record.\" The engine, which retired from service in 1963, has been restored for the National Railway Museum (NRM).

Let\\'s buy a bottle of Rum, so I drop another 600 dollars on that. The bottle comes and we start drinking and dancing some more. I\\'m now successfully drunk and getting tired..but the nice thing is that I have a table..my own little area so I sit down and fall asleep, now usually sleeping in a club is a no no, but I have a table and my own area, I should be able to close my eyes for a second, I mean by this time it\\'s only 1:30 in the morning and the club stays open till 5. I still have a good three hours to party.

The first guy I pointed at said, how about I put you on the VIP list at Drais and I\\'ll meet you there when I get off...\"Sounds good to me!! he took out his phone and put me on there and said..see you there they then took me to some door, to off the handcuffs and pushed me out on to the sidewalk.

Lessons would make sense and be engaging for all students. Classes would start to be more enjoyable to attend since everyone would understand the content. Less students would be likely to miss classes with such engaging lessons. The less classes the students miss, the more they understand and learn. Eventually grades and test scores would improve as well, making schoolwork less stressful. In general students would be learning more content in an easier way which would make them happier about school and learning in general.\\n\\nTeachers would be next in line to benefit from the new technology. A teacher's success is based on the student's success. With the students learning more, doing well on tests, and being happier overall, a lot of the strain put on teachers would get taken away. Teachers are able to relax more and maybe even get paid more from the success of their students. Parents wouldn't have to blame teachers for not giving their children a chance to succeed either.

       " Document(page_content=\"Dear Principal,\\n\\nI believe that the policy for cell phones in the schools should be for students to be allowed to bring phones to school and to be allowed to use them in lunch periods and other free times. I believe this because in our society today, easier communication has become a necessity, and I cannot see any apparent reason on why phones should have forbidden use in times of the day were students are allowed to talk and enjoy themselves. School is a place for learning, but in free times of the day students should be allowed to listen to music, cell phones, etc.. Allowing students to have cell phones in free periods and lunch would give the student body a higher respect for the staff and faculty of the school for giving them the privilege to have there cell phones with them in free times, and I believe that this would result in more courtesy and respect in the student body towards staff, faculty, and each other. I do not disagree with students to have forbidden use of there cell phones during class because it would get in the way of a student's education, and this could result in bigger problems later on in there lives. the student body on it's part should not have a disregard for cell phone use in class, and should respect and honor the privilege given to them. If cell phone use is given to students in free times of the day, I believe the student body can uphold its part, and this would definitely result in a better community in the school.

       " Document(page_content='I nearly threw up at my first lacrosse practice. I was in 8th grade and terrified of the high school girls that I would be playing with. When I walked onto the field the girls seemed like giants, they towered over me, huffing and puffing from running. They were almost bull-like. My stomach became even more nauseous when the coach put this foreign object called a cross in my hands. I was at the bottom of the list. I initially started playing the second half of the JV game, maybe a few seconds in the first. Furthermore, I worked hard at practice and at home, playing with my lacrosse stick and carrying it around. The more I played, the deeper I fell in love with the sport. As I gained more skills with my stick I started to gain more play time and the trust of the upperclassmen as well. Once I became a freshman the academic difficulty was kicked up a notch. I discovered the difficult challenge of being a high school athlete and a high school academic. What with managing tests and quizzes and reports on top of practice, I started to feel buried under all the work. Over time, though, I began to balance my class work and my sport. I learned to plan my studying and homework time around my practices. I started to gain a sense of self-discipline. Furthermore, I was elated to see that studying a few days before my test because I had a game the night before was paying off as my grades began to improve. That reinforced what I was doing to prepare for school, so even during the off season, I started studying earlier from the test date. In my sophomore year our only goalie was a senior, which meant that someone had to start training for the spot. I have always had very good hand-eye coordination and quick reflexes, so after some badgering from the senior goalie I decided to step up and become goalie. I spent most practice inside the goal learning techniques, but when I learned the most was on the field. Being goalie was something I had never aspired to do, but the first time I stepped into the crease during a game I felt like I was in a new house, it was bare and blank; my job was to decorate and make it my home. I kept training during the summer of my sophomore year, working on improving my goalie skills. When the season of my junior year started, I felt much more confident in goal. Just because I was more confident in goal my junior year, doesn\\'t mean that I had everything under control. My emotions became a big challenge to control. Every time a shot was made, I took it personally. I would start to cry in goal, which would bring my teammates down. Then I would feel guilty, and it would create an endless cycle. At that point I realized that being goalie wasn\\'t just my position, it was my chance to lead. I realized that as a goalie, I have a special view of the whole field. I can see the holes in the offense. Then I direct my teammates on how to defend. Even when the team is down, all it takes is a bit of energy to influence the mood. This is where I am most affective, whether it is a pep talk at half-time or by screeching \"Good Job\" across the field. That motivated me to keep my emotions in check and to encourage my teammates. Through my four years of playing lacrosse I have learned a lot about myself. I am a hard worker, I enjoy ... I am still working on this part, but any comments on the rest of my essay would be great!'),\n",

It\\'s empty except for two chocolates wrapped in purple foil and stamped with a mushroom. I begin to unwrap them as I dial Remedy. With a mouth full of chocolate: \"Yo..... we\\'re on.

He attached the custom extra large trash bag to the vaporizer and turned it on. Once the bag was full he detached it at went out on the deck of his penthouse loft over looking the city. He could practically throw a ball into the stadium from here. After a deep breath and a long exhale he began to suck the bag. When he was about half way done his feet began to turn to smoke. Soon his entire body was shrouded in smoke, and just as the last puff entered his mouth the bag dropped to ground. Vapor silently descended on the stadium to assess the situation. As I sat in my car my perception of my surroundings slowly began to waver. Where I ended and the car seat began was no longer clear, and soon I could discern no boundaries at all.

Furthermore, it will be discuss below.  \\n  \\nOne serious problem that can be arise from the changing in family structure and role is that it can provoke the housewifery problem. For instance, many mothers decide to be a career woman, leave the house, and hand the house affairs over to the assistant. Moreover, some women also require their husbands to handle duties at home and take care of their child. This will be triggered a dispute even to divorce in the household relations.  \\n  \\nAnother issue is that it will be interfered the children development. Some studies have reported that many cases of juvenile delinquency caused by the lack of parental function which affects children's development. To illustrate, the modification of roles and structure can be deflected the real function of parents in the family. As a result, the children will endure lack of attention and affection because the parental role is weak.

       " Document(page_content='The Antioxidant Properties of Peptides Essay (Article)\\n\\nThe synthesis of the most active fragments of peptides is possible when identifying the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC-FL) of component amino acids in these parts of peptides. Thus, the highest value of oxygen radical absorbance capacity was determined for Trp, and high ORAC-FL values were identified for Tyr and Met. This aspect indicates the significant and rather high antioxidant activity of these amino acids.\\n\\nThe lower antioxidant activity was typical of Cys, His, and Phe. Other amino acids, including Arg, Asn, Gln, and Asp among them, did not demonstrate any antioxidant activity. The explanation of the activity for Trp and Tyr is based on the ability of the indolic and phenolic groups to perform as hydrogen donors. As a result, stable indoyl and phenoxyl radicals become formed. In its turn, Met is oxidised, but Cys provides the sulfur hydrogen. Thus, the radical scavenging activity, in this case, is explained by the presence of Trp, Tyr, Met, and His in peptides.\\n\\nThe synthesis process and the focus on radical scavenging activity for three sequences of active peptides indicated that the sequence Trp-Tyr-Ser- Leu-Ala-Met-Ala-Ala-Ser-Asp-Ile had high antioxidant activity. The radical scavenging activity was about 1.7- and 4-fold lower than it is of the flavonoid quercetin and p -coumaric acid, but antioxidant activity was higher than the activity of butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), which is a synthetic antioxidant with adverse effects.\\n\\nConsequently, BHA is proposed to be replaced with natural antioxidants. In order to improve food antioxidant properties and prevent the oxidation reaction, such natural antioxidants as hydrolysates from whey proteins can be utilised, and they can be obtained from cheese whey, for example. Comparing protein hydrolysates to antioxidants from plants, it is important to accentuate their extra nutritional value, but their antigenicity should also be considered before using them in food.\\n\\nThe capacity of this sequence is explained by the presence of Trp, Tyr, and Met. It is important to note that the antioxidant activity of amino acids can be weakened because of the peptidic bond and structural peptide conformation, and radical scavenging activity can be decreased when several amino acids are present because of antagonist effects.\\n\\nOther two sequences also indicated the radical scavenging activity because of the presence of Met and Tyr, but the antioxidant activity of these amino acids was even higher when they were measured separately. Moreover, the antioxidant activity of these amino acids was improved because of the peptidic bond and structural peptide conformation in contrast to the analysis of the previous sequence. Thus, both synergistic and antagonistic effects can be observed when several amino acids are present, influencing the radical scavenging activity.\\n\\nThe authors of the article conclude that this study is the first one to discuss the antioxidant properties of peptides that are taken from whey proteins with the help of enzymatic hydrolysis. In order to obtain antioxidant hydrolysates, Corolase PP is suitable to be used.\\n\\nThe tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) was used to identify 42 peptides. Among them, the focus of the authors was on the peptide Trp-Tyr-Ser- Leu-Ala-Met-Ala-Ala-Ser-Asp-Ile because of its high antioxidant activity that was greater than the capacity of BHA. Furthermore, the researchers accentuated specific synergistic and antagonistic effects on the antioxidant activity that resulted from the peptide conformation of the amino acids. Therefore, further research is required in order to examine these effects in detail with the focus on the antioxidant activity.\\n'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Child Death Causes by World Health Organization Essay (Article)\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has been actively researching various causes of infant mortality within the six WHO regions. However, success in this regard depends on the accuracy of the information provided. This paper shall set out to summarize an article that addresses the link between infant mortality and accurate information flow worldwide.\\n\\nMain body\\n\\nIn the article WHO estimates of the causes of death in children , by Jennifer Bryce, Cynthia Boschi-Pinto, Kenji Shibuya, Robert Black, et al, the authors base their article on the fact that child survival efforts can be efficiently achieved through the provision and availability of accurate information regarding the causes of infant death. As such, they use this article in a bid to show what the WHO did in order to improve the accuracy of this information within a four years period. They state that the provision and availability of accurate information plays a pivotal role in the establishment, delivery, and measurement of disease-specific interventions.\\n\\nTo support their claim, the authors use different quantitative and qualitative methods to analyze and interpret the data. A case study of WHO is the primary source of information, while correlative techniques are used to establish the link between child mortality and specific diseases within the six WHO regions. The authors present their findings in a logical and comprehensive manner, detailing the challenges faced during the compilation of the data, as well as the procedures implemented to address these challenges.\\n\\nFrom their findings, it is evident that there were six major causes that led to the death of over ten million children below the age of five from 2000 to 2003. These diseases caused 73% of all infant deaths recorded within this period. According to the authors, the World Health Organization뗩 findings indicated that malaria, pneumonia, diarrhea, neonatal sepsis, premature deliveries, and asphyxia at birth were the most rampant causes of death within the six WHO regions.\\n\\nIn addition, the information provided revealed that malnutrition played a significant role in over 50% of all infant deaths. In their discussion, the authors state that while some diseases such as HIV/AIDS, measles, and tetanus pose no serious threat, they should not be ignored. They attribute this to the fact that these diseases still cause death and procedures and programs should be developed in order to counter these growing threats. On the same note, the authors recommend that the accurate information published by the WHO should be used in a bid to provide disease-specific interventions. They argue that researchers should team up so as to provide accurate information.\\n\\nFinally, the authors state that the revelation of such accurate information has played a pivotal role in sensitizing the public about these diseases, fostering childcare prioritization, and providing a strong foundation for measurement. Through this information, malnutrition, which is a major underlying cause of infant deaths, can be addressed effectively all over the world.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nDiseases such as malaria, cholera, and HIV/AIDS pose serious threats to the livelihoods of most people living in less developed nations. This article provides an avenue through which child-health epidemiology can be strengthened and public-health policy development initiated within such nations. The authors have effectively supported their case with verifiable data. As such, this article is not only a good and informative piece of work but also, a guide that can be used by nations to combat infant mortality within their populations worldwide.\\n'),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Knowledge, it is one of the most powerful things in the world. How do people gain knowledge? They gain information from their mentors, teachers, coaches, parents, and older siblings. People are always learning something new everyday, from how to do long division to how to make friends. The school districts are creating projects for students to do over the summer so they can continue to learn while out of school. Although some say that teacher-design is better and more effective, student-design actually can benefit the students more by opening up their imagination and also expands their creativity.\\n\\nSummer is mean't for fun and laughter, not being kept inside all day working on a project the teacher assigned over summer break. The whole point of summer is being away from school and having a vacation. So wouldn't students prefer to do a project about something that they are passionate about? Indeed, studies show that when students do school work that they choose and are passionate about their work ends up being more creative and overall better performance. Students are just growing up and in school they aren't allowed to truly express themselves because they are either too shy or the class doesn't discuss their interests. Teenagers only want to do and listen to what they want, they don't want a teacher giving them homework over summer break not even to mention that it is not something they enjoy. Creating a summer project that the students can create on their own with their brilliant minds will not only increase there productivity level, but also make them love school more because they get to do something that inspires them.\\n\\nHowever, students grow up doing what they are told by their parents and teachers. Having a teacher planned project can be very beneficial because students more times than not, when doing something they don't like, they end up getting offtask or going the easy way out. That is why they need to have structure and guidelines. What ends up happening is when a student is struggling they procrastinate or end up not doing it at all. This branches from when students have difficulty coming up with their own ideas and are stuck trying to figure out what to do. That is why having a teacher based project is more effective because students are given what they need all they have to do is complete the assignment.\\n\\nIn conclusion, students grow up with an endless imagination and one day eventually it dies when they grow up to become adults. That is why a student-design project can end up being more beneficial than supposed to having a teacher assign the students a project where they aren't going to have fun and in the end will probably forget what the project was about. Students learn better when they do something that interests them and benefit more from that then to do a project about the presidents.\\n\\nHaving a teacher-design project has minimal benefits, that is why having a student-design project, which opens up great minds and can help students comprehend better what they are learning when doing something they enjoy.\"),\n",

The room is large (650sf) and spaced out nicely with a sunken living room that boast an L shaped sofa, large work desk, dining table, 32 lcd tv, coffee table and ottoman. The king sized bed was the perfect combination of soft and firmness with lots of pillows. The only issue I had with the bed that it wasn\\'t your typical king sized bed. The width was correct but the length of the bed was short and my toes touched the end of the bed and I know im not a tall person. There is also a 32\" lcd tv for the bedroom as well. The bathroom has a separate enclosed shower and roman tub with a double sink and a small lcd tv. The toilet is enclosed in a tiny room which was a bit odd. The shades and curtain completely blackout the sun and can be remotely controlled. I would suggest staying in one of the upper floors if you want to sleep in since they have pool parties and can be heard from our 28th floor room. Checking in was easy and quick. If you plan to valet your car, do it at the entrance valet area and not the back one. We valet our car in the back area and had to walk all the way to the front to check in and walk all the way back to reach the 3 elevators for the tower.

       " Document(page_content='Several species\\' vision was studied by an international team to identify this ultra-violet (UV) sensitivity. The findings, published in the journal Conservation Biology, claimed habitats and migration could be disrupted. The flashes, or corona, occur when charge builds up in a cable and is released into the air. The international team, including scientists from University College London and the Arctic University of Norway, measured the spectrum of light emitted by these bursts of charge. They worked out that although the light was invisible to us, it contained wavelengths seen by many other mammals. \"Most mammals will let some [UV light] into their eye,\" explained UCL vision expert Prof Glen Jeffery, one of the lead researchers in this project. \"We\\'re weird - us and monkeys - because we don\\'t see UV. Most animals do.\" The first animal to reveal its UV sensitivity was the reindeer. And, as the researchers explained, reindeers\\' avoidance of the power lines running across the Arctic tundra was part of the inspiration for this project. Dr Nicholas Tyler, the other lead author, said it had been assumed that rather than avoiding the power cables themselves, animals steered clear of passages cut in forested areas before pylons were installed. \"Forest animals will not cross clear-cuts,\" he said. \"But for us in the Arctic, avoidance of power lines is difficult to explain - there are no trees, yet the reindeer still avoid the power lines.\" The animals keep as much as 5km (3 miles) from either side of the cables. \"This has been a mystery,\" Dr Tyler added. \"We have now come up with a mechanism [to explain it].\" This research required a detailed understanding of animal vision, which was where Prof Jeffery came in. Having discovered in 2011 that reindeer eyes were sensitive to UV light, Prof Jeffery went on to study the eyes of almost 40 mammal species, revealing all were UV-sensitive. Since, as the researchers added, coronas \"happen on all power lines everywhere,\" the avoidance of the flashes could be having a global impact on wildlife. \"It has always been assumed that power lines - masts and the cables strung between them - were passive structures standing immobile in the terrain, and therefore inoffensive for animals,\" said Dr Tyler. \"As a result of this work, we now consider them as chains of flashing light stretching across the tundra in the winter darkness, and that\\'s why the animals find them so offensive.\" The random and unpredictable nature of these flashes were particularly problematic, he added, as the animals could not easily adapt to them. Prof Jeffery said he hoped power companies would now consider ways to address the issue.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"When was the last time you asked for advice? When in such a situation, it is important to ask more than one person. If you just went to one person, you could end up getting really bad advice.\\xa0Asking lots of people will allow you to evaluate multiple opinions. It also gives you control over the decision you are making, as you ultimately decide which of the options to choose. You can also come up with your own solution based off of the solutions of others. Asking multiple people allows for the freedom of choice and, consequently, a better choice.\\n\\nHowever, when only asking one person, you may end up with bad advice. For example, when I was little, I asked my older brother for help on my homework. I assumed that since he had been through the class, he knew exactly what he was doing. Instead, he had forgotten how to do it, and mislead me. If I had asked my mom and dad, then I would have been able to reason that if they both got the same answer, they were right. My trust in one person's advice led me to get a C on my homework, and a break in my otherwise straight As.\\n\\nThough only asking one person can lead to bad advice, there are times when the advice given is good. This is especially true if you ask someone you can trust. It is important to keep in mind, however, that the advice given still may not be the best, and to get the best advice possible, you will have to consult multiple people. Currently, I am scheduling classes for high school, and have talked with my mom about it. She has helped me arrange things so that I can meet all the requirements while still taking the classes I want to take. While I trust her and know that the advice she has given me is good, I plan on visiting the school counselor to make sure that everything works, and to get more advice. I know the school counselor will have better advice because she knows the most about planning for high school. It is crucial that I listen to her if I want the best advice.\\n\\nUsing these methods will usually get you good advice, but it requires blind trust in someone else's advice to get you precisely what you want. Good advice should make you think about what you want to do instead of telling you how to do it. By evaluating the advice given to you, you can find the parts that make the most sense to you and formulate your own idea based on them. When I finalize my plan for high school, I will use both my mom's advice, the counselor's advice, and my own idea of what I want to do to create the best plan. Using other people's advice in conjunction with mine will give me a plan that helps me accomplish exactly what I want.\\n\\nThere are many ways to find and use advice. No matter how you do it, the end result should reflect your wants and needs. Asking many people is the best way of doing this, because it allows you to choose what you know is best for you, and not just what one person may think. This leads to independent decisions that put you on a path to becoming the person that you want to be. Clearly, when looking for advice, consulting many people is an important start.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='As far as I understand, one tenet of mainstream feminism is that there is a distinction between sex and gender. Sex is a biological trait. As far as I know, the defining biological feature of a female is that it produces relatively large gametes (sex cells). The defining feature of a male is that it produces small gametes. Gender, on the other hand, is culturally defined. The overwhelming majority of human cultures assign certain gender roles to biological males, and other gender roles to biological females. An example of a \\'gender\\' difference might be that men and women in the Western world wear different clothes. An example of a \\'sex\\' defference might be that men have deeper voices and tend to be physically stronger. However, I don\\'t think the gendersex dichotomy is as clear as some people would have us believe. If I were to accept the distinction, I would have to agree that any trait could clearly be classified as \"biological\" or \"cultural.\" I think this is an overly reductionist point of view, and that in fact most traits will be influenced by both biology and culture. In fact, I think biology itself influences culture, and culture influences biology. The two are intertwined, and it\\'s rarely possible to pick one apart from another. Therefore, I conclude that sex and gender are intertwined, and that it\\'s rarely possible to pick one from the other. As an example of a trait that (from my point of view) does not clearly fall into one camp or another, let\\'s take competitiveness (or agression, as another example). Men tend to be more agressive than women. It\\'s less obvious that they\\'re more competitive, but I think a case can be made.

And particularly when it comes to school projects, students choose to work alone, in groups, or merely with the guidance of an experienced tutor. Personally, I would rather work with a group of classmates than alone or with a tutor for reasons related to the inefficiency of solo as well as supervised work.  \\n  \\nFirst of all, solo work can be boring and, frankly, one-sided, colorless and unimaginative in many ways. In fact, when we choose to isolate from people in projects, we automatically isolate ourselves from different perspectives, diverse experiences and new ideas. Moreover, encapsulating one\\'s thinking can only lead to making it vulnerable and outdated as not only it is separated from the influence of other personalities, it is threatened with deterioration and perishing. Indeed, ideas should always be revised and enhanced.  \\n  \\nFurthermore, working with a tutor is, by all means, a threat to the improvisation and imagination of the young mind. Initially, we can all agree with the fact that a progressive and innovative project can only be achieved by having a horizontal relationship between the parties involved in its development. However, engaging a tutor in the work of a \"student\" can only be regarded as breaking the aforementioned rule. Thus, as crucial a tutor can be to accelerating and crafting any school work, it is also important to note that the importance of school projects lie in the effort put in not just the yield. If anything tutors can make projects effortless, hence, meaningless.  \\n  \\nLastly, I would choose to work with a group of my classmates in a school project for the rich, diverse and sometimes unique perspectives they can all bring. And as awkward and messy group work can be, the discussions that students have, within or outside of the main ideas of the topic at hand, can be beneficial, awarding them a short-term success in the project and a long-term success in maturing and strengthening friendships. As a matter of fact, as socializing opportunities become rarer than ever for students, school projects can provide a time to catch up and converse within a homogeneous unit.  \\n  \\nOverall, school projects can be the perfect time to shape new perspectives on different topics, away from the usual, somewhat boring, homework routine. Thus, it is an opportunity to both learn and mature, and socialize. For that reason, regardless of the project, I would always choose to do it within a group of my cohort.  \\n  \\n**\\\\* Please give it a grade out of 15.**'),\n",

Will the car be able to determine where to stop if it is approaching a stop sign? There are too many \"what ifs\" with a driverless car for me to feel safe to ride in one, or to even have one driving on the street around me.\\n\\nTo me, there are a variety of things that can go wrong when you are allowing the car drive all by itself. There are too many questions that need to be answerd about these new cars. For example, how will the car react to a sudden change in the environment? If another car gets to close will it swerve out of the way potentionally causing an accident? Even if the car notifies the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, what will happen if the driver isn\\'t notified in time? Also, if one of the sensors on the car were to be broken or damaged, then how could the car continue to drive on its own? Would it notify the driver that a new part is needed? If the car were to get into an accident, who would be to blame, the driver or the company that created the car? Would it depend if it was on manual control or automatic? These questions are the main reasons why the driverless cars need to be improved before I will even think about ridding in one. I know that I would rather know exactly what I am doing and how it will be done instead of having a car try to do it for me.\\n\\nI think that driverless cars are a terrible idea. There are too many problems that can occur during the driving process, and I don\\'t want my life in the hands of a car that can\\'t see or think the way that a human does. If during some parts of the drive it requires a human to take the wheel, why have it automatically drive you? Wouldn\\'t it get tiring waiting for your turn to drive, especially when you aren\\'t sure when the car is going to have you take over? You must stay focused on the road and have both hands on the wheel, so you could very easliy just drive the car yourself without the worry. This way you can control the situations that you get into, and not having a car get you into trouble that you might not be able to get out of. I think that it is much more safe to have a human that can respond quickly to change and can manuver through obsticals than to have a car, that might not see everything in its environment, drive automatically through it.

       " Document(page_content='The button feels pretty solid under my thumb. It\\'s the last day of my first term. Things around the world are getting worse, and there are a thousand smaller projects that I wish I had time to fix. But the President of the United States only has so much time, and only so many things he can do. I\\'m waiting on the VP to come down for our last meeting of the day. But she is taking her sweet time getting here. And I\\'ll be honest, I\\'ve been curious about this thing ever since I sat down in the big chair. It isn\\'t labeled, there is no explanation of where it goes. I remember I had an idea to get an electrician out to see where it was wired, but that didn\\'t pan out either. There are some wires, but they seem to meld with another wire, and that one melds with a few more. The guy said he\\'d never seen anything like it. So I left it. Small mystery, for a small world. But it\\'s been staring at me ever since I took this job. And I have to know. The button itself is bright, and red. It never seems to get dusty, even when I\\'m away from the office for a week or three. It\\'s not like one of those buttons in the arcades. It has some heft to it. You have to put some weight down on the button to get it to press down. And I\\'m sorry, but I had to do it. What would you do? For an instant, nothing happens. And for a few minutes more, still, nothing. I figured if a bomb went off, the red phone would start ringing. But it\\'s eerily quiet. I decide to grab the regular phone, and call up Sheryl, since I\\'m waiting on her. But there\\'s no dial tone. I shake my head, and walk to the door, opening it. \"Hey, Sam can you give Sheryl a call? And get someone from maintenance down here to check on the phone? There\\'s no dial tone.\" But Sam doesn\\'t move. The guards down at the end of the hall don\\'t move either. I nudged one of them, and he fell like a ton of bricks. But he didn\\'t get back up. I think I had a mini panic attack at that point, so I ran outside to get some air. And noticed some birds..... frozen in the sky. What had I done?'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='At first, joining boy scouts seemed as though it was a waste of time. Camping, and doing community service wasn\\'t something I was interested in taking the time to do. Little did I know, that through boy scouts I met some of my closest friends, and created some of my most cherished memories. For this reason, I believe\\xa0students should be required to take a extracurricular curricular activities, because they come with many obvious benefits that have effect on the students and school community as a whole.\\n\\nRequiring students to take extracurricular activities can get them to try something new they\\'ve never done before. This comes with many benefits, first, students will get to learn a new skills they\\'ve never touched on before. For example, if a student was in boy scouts and they learned about wood whittling, they may become very interested in that certain skill and take classes in school related to the skill, such as 3D art. As a result, that particular student may want to pursue 3D art as their future career. Second, the students will learn to become open to trying out new things. When someone discovers something new that they really like, they will try to expand that scope of interest, and try to learn new things surrounding that original interest. Thus, creating a healthy way for the students to challenge themselves through their interests.\\n\\nExtracurricular activities are a great way to get people, to get together. Seeing other students at school is a good way to meet new people as well, but not everyone has the same interests, and that\\'s where extracurricular activities \"one-up\" regular school time. When your in a group of people of similar interests it becomes easier to connect to people in the group, and extracurricular activities provide just that. Thus, creating stronger bonds between the students which benefits the students in many other areas of life. First, you\\'ll have more people you can rely on and trust. Having someone you can trust is important, for example, if you were feeling down about something, you\\'d have someone who has your back and that you can talk to. Second, you\\'ll feel much better about yourself. Being part of a strong friendship makes you feel included, more confident, and less insecure in yourself.\\n\\nLastly, being apart of an extracurricular activity can help benefit the community. Groups just like boy scouts always have events focused on improving the community planned. Through these events, students learn how to raise awareness and start community projects through first-hand experience. Boy scouts, however, is not the only extracurricular group that benefits communities. Groups such as the student council help shape the school policy to work with both students and teachers. They also raise awareness through events such as empty bowl night, which is an event where you buy a student made bowl to raise money for people in poverty.\\n\\nIn conclusion, students should be required to participate in extracurricular activities. Making it a requirement can get students to learn new things, meet new people, and help the community. By supporting these smaller local extracurricular groups, or making it a requirement to be apart of one such as boy scouts. The youth of our community can reach their potential, and learn the necessary life skills needed to pursue a healthy future.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"**The government can take a variety of actions to help protect the environment. Which one of the following do you think is the most important for the nation's government to take to protect the environment?**  \\n  \\n**1. Fund the research to develop environmentally friendly energy sources such as solar and wind energy.  \\n2. Preserve the natural places like forests and protect the animals that live there.  \\n3. Enforce laws to prevent the pollution of air and water by large companies.**  \\n  \\n## environmental pollution laws should be implemented\\n\\n  \\n  \\nNowadays, environmental pollution has emerged as one of the most urgent issues of the government to handle and government is obliged to take necessary measures to protect it from contamination. Some experts have come up with three plausible solutions, from environmentally-friendly energy source development, to the protection of natural habits and wild animals, and to forbidding businesses to emit air or water pollution by law. Among all these three suggestions, I suppose that enforcing laws to prohibit air or water contamination by huge corporations is the best option.  \\n  \\nFirst, compared with the other two choices, implementing laws on corporate pollution is much more economical. If the government decides to invent new environmentally friendly energy, they have to recruit relevant experts and specialists, for whom it has to pay thousands of dollars to make the best of their brain and talents to get the project finished. Also, if the government decides to protect natural forests or wild animals, they are likely to choose a place as a potential spot of a wildlife reserve and then spend a tremendous amount of money contacting several construction companies to build this natural protection area. However, when it comes to enforcing laws to prevent the air and water pollutions by huge companies, it may just take a few officials to draw up the first draft and wait for the congress to pass it. It won't add any single financial burden to the government.  \\n  \\nSecond, the law on water or air pollution is the very prerequisite for the other two solutions. Even though the government successfully innovate new energy sources such as solar and geothermal energy, the contamination issue wouldn't be well tackled if the pollution released by huge firms is so severe and even out of control. Similarly, one of the threats to forests and animals is man-made pollution, whether water or air. If no laws has been passed to put a curb on companies' emission of pollutants, the natural habits and animals dwelling there could be harmed continuously, even endlessly. Therefore, as we can see, it is vital to establish laws to ban companies from releasing and emitting their chemicals wastes or toxic discharges. Without these necessities, the other two options are just like buildings erecting without a solid foundation and someday it may collapse eventually.  \\n  \\nIn a nutshell, among all these three possibilities, drawing up and implementing environmental pollution laws is the one I prefer.  \\n  \\n*P.S: I'd appreciate if you could help me revise my toefl essay.

Even thow if a tie the election would be thrown to the house of represenatives were they decide on the new president. The electoral college is a process its not a place. It shows that the founding fathers established it for the compromise between elections between the president by a vote in congress. The electoral college consists of 538 electors. Plus a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president .It say's in the passage that under the 23rd Amendment of the constiton that the district of colombia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for the purposes of electoral college. On many cases 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election. The electoral college system states that voters vote not for the president,but for a state of eletors who elect the president. I think that they should have the right to elect the president that would make this nation grow stonger not to make mistakes and lead us to problems which they can decide to choose the future of the united states. Many people have diffrent opinions as me but not all will get the same results as they wanted. The effects of the electoral college has been giving us positive values.

       " Document(page_content=\"Well, all that is on my mind sure cannot be summed up in twenty minutes, but I will continually type for that time. Lately I have desired to do nothing but become closer to God. He is awesome. My freshman year of high school was great all because I had God on my side. Now I feel like I have lost him. I know He is still there for me, but I have damaged that relationship that we had. I chose to live my life and not listen to Him. It hurts because life was stressfree and I always knew that God was just right there waiting for me everywhere I went. When I would walk outside I would smile and greet God with open arms. Now I feel like sometimes I look negatively upon the weather and don't even think of the great God who made everything. I have been trying to become closer to God. I read in the Bible more often. Rather than praying for myself or for God to do great works in my life, I now ask God what I can do to better the lives of others. I think that my outlook on life will change once I fully begin to ask Him what He wants of me rather than demanding Him to help me. I think once my relationship with Him improves, my money worries will go away. One worry is about transferring out of the school of business. I could transfer out of the business school, but I am afraid of what my future holds. I know with a business degree at UT jobs will be flying at me from every direction. Instead of being a cutthroat businesswoman, I want to help society. If I would get paid a good amount, I would definitely help the homeless or disabled. That attitude is wrong. God does not want me to think like that. He wants me to trust that He will provide all my financial necessities. He wants me to pray to Him to find out what I need to do in life. He will give me meaning once I am fully ready to accept His answer. I continually pray to God asking Him what I am to do with my life. He has not told me. I do not think it is that He has not told me; I think He has told me to wait for the right time for him to tell me. I know He will let me know when He feels I am ready to accept the task He has prepared for me. Right now I long to know what that task is. As I read the Bible daily and pray to Him daily, I feel I am taking one step closer to receiving a better understanding of my life and knowing what I am destined to do. I cannot wait until God shows me the way to my career, my husband, my kids, my destiny, but I always have to remember what my mom says. God and her both agree: patience is a virtue and in order to obtain these goals, I need to be patient. \"),\n",

Growing up in that kind of country, they never got the chance to get a proper education or even a decent job to have a good life. When I was only a year old, my parents decided to come to the United States of America, so I could get the proper education to have a good life. Growing up in California, my parents would always emphasize the importance of education and how closely it is related to being successful in life. I would not really pay attention to those words because I was just too young to know what it meant.

I was a kid and I thought there were more important things to do than get good grades in school. I got a C on my first test and my parents told me it was ok, but they wanted me to get a better grade the second time. When my second test was graded, it turned out to be a D. When I was coming home that day, I was thinking that today is going to be the worst day of my life and that I am not going to be allowed to do anything. When I got home, my parents already knew that I had a bad grade because my teacher had already called and told them about it. Surprisingly, they were not mad. They took me to my room and started talking to me. They started telling me a story that I would never forget. Furthermore, they told me about their childhood where they grew up in a bad country where they could not go to school, and they told me that there was no chance to go to college or let alone graduate from high school. Hearing my parents tell me these stories of about their childhood really changed me as a person because it made me realize how lucky I am to be living here where there are public schools that can give me the best education possible. From this talk I knew that truly the most important thing in life is having a good education and my dream from that day on has always been to go to college and get the best education possible to make my parents proud and myself proud.

       " Document(page_content='Sex and Gender Definition and Comparison Essay\\n\\nSex and gender are the particular notions which should not be confused. Sex 랈arks the distinction between women and men as result of the fundamental biological, physical and genetic differences between them (Narasaiah 37), while gender roles are 랍et by convention and other social, economic, political and cultural forces (Narasaiah 37). Therefore, it is possible to conclude that sex is the item which cannot be chosen as people are born with some particular signs which maybe deleted by means of surgeon operations, but it is not preferable. Gender is more flexible item which maybe changed depending on the personal will and social norms. The main idea of the paper is to consider the difference of sex and gender on the basis of the case of David Reimer.\\n\\nConsidering the situation with David Reimer, it is possible to say that a person was offered to live with another sex, but the gender roles in the society could not be changed. Being a girl up to 9 years, David Reimer felt some problems, being 랍he he was unable to lead a normal life. However, it is not that easy to shift from one gender to another especially when issue is about changing the sex. Reading the story about David Reimer in the CBC News Online (n.p.), it was obvious that a person felt some problems, it was obvious David Reimer, being a girl experienced some problems which could not be explained.\\n\\nDavid Reimer뗩 father decided to tell the truth? Was he right? It is impossible to answer this question. Everything was done. David Reimer appeared in the situation when he could not find his gender role and social status. He could not even say his sexual orientation as being grown up as a girl with the direction at being with boys David Reimer had to change his attitude to the whole world, but he could no. It was really difficult for him to live even after having understood his male sex and trying to be of the male gender. The reasons of his death are called the inability to live without a twin brother, but this is not the real reason as the suicide. The inability to find out the gender role, people are unable to live in the society.\\n\\nAs for me, I suppose that in the modern world with too much prejudice and the inability of others to understand some gender roles of people sex reassignment of children is inadmissible (Macionis and Gerber 125). Such cases are possible in the world free from prejudice, but considering the political and financial impact of the social situation in the world, the indifference and normal attitude to sex and gender of people will always play an important role. Those children who are submitted to the practice of sex reassignment of children should be carefully treated. The work should be done with professional psychologists.\\n\\nThus, it is important to state that the practice of sex reassignment of children is not that spread in our society and it should not be spread as people are not ready for this. Gender roles and sex are very important for them and the chances to lead a normal life with the changed of at least one of the factors is difficult. Even people with different orientation are not accepted in this society, people with changed gender roles. There is nothing to say about the practice of sex reassignment of children.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nNarasaiah, Mark Lee. Population and cities . New York: Discovery Publishing House, 2006.

Average Store Size\\n\\nSales\\n\\nGap뗩 sales grew significantly between 2000 and 2004, signifying a period of economic success. Notably, this tendency contradicts the display in the text, which claims that sales slowed in 2000 and hardly grew in 2001. The claim that sales growth slowed but did not stop can explain 2000, but the rise in 2001 directly contradicts the claim that sales grew only 1%. In the next two years, the sales began increasing due to the appearance of the new director, Paul S. Pressler. However, they peaked in 2004 and started slowly declining until 2007, when a sharp drop occurred. This change can be attributed to the leadership of Glenn Murphy, who assumed the CEO뗩 position at the time. However, the new executive was eventually able to recover the company뗩 sales and return them to the level close to that at his arrival by 2012.\\n\\nOperating Profit\\n\\nGap began the period of 2000-2012 with a steep drop in its operating profits, caused by its misjudgment of fashion trends in 2000. The company was able to recover in 2001, and the new CEO, Paul S. Pressler, continued the trend of improving operating profits in 2002 and 2003. However, similarly to sales, operating profits peaked then and began declining to a level similar to those before the manager뗩 appearance. He was able to start recovery but was replaced by Glenn Murphy in 2007. Murphy concentrated on increasing operating profits, continuing the growth steadily until 2011. At that time, the staff replacements and other issues, such as the emergence of large competitors who were able to outsell Gap led to a drop in the KPI, but the value recovered to its 2010 level in 2012.\\n\\nGross Margin\\n\\nGap뗩 gross margin dropped significantly in 2001, most likely due to the aforementioned failure of the company to follow the trends that made sales and discounts necessary to liquidate the goods. It began recovering in 2002 when Pressler took the lead. However, like the other statistics, the KPI peaked in 2004 and began declining afterward. The fall continued until 2007 when Murphy assumed leadership and began working on recovering profits. The efforts were successful until 2009 when both Inditex and H&M overtook Gap as the largest specialty apparel retailer. The effect manifested in full force in 2011, with a steep drop to the gross margin. However, Gap뗩 management was able to stabilize the situation somewhat, and the decline was less severe in 2012, though still present.\\n\\nAverage Store Size\\n\\nGap expanded its stores considerably in 2001, likely expecting its rapid expansion to continue, but the misjudgment came as a surprise. As such, its growth slowed, but continued nevertheless, as Pressler뗩 policy was to close underperforming stores and open new ones, though slower than before. The increases continued throughout Pressler뗩 entire tenure in the company except for a small drop in 2006, where the company뗩 performance began declining, and the CEO was fired. Fisher was able to continue the trend, but Murphy started to shrink stores as part of his cost-saving policy. He began investing in online sales, which did not require physical store space to occur, and so the company뗩 brick-and-mortar locations continued shrinking throughout the period until 2012. The drop in 2008 is likely sharper than that in 2009 due to the increasing prominence of Inditex and H&M, which forced Gap to cut costs quickly. Its recovery enabled the company to conduct the process more steadily later.\\n'),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"In order for democracy to work, we put faith in the people. We believe that the majority of people will be able to successfully elect a government that represents their people. I believe that democracy has been sustainable in the United States because the majority of people were smart enough to elect leaders who had the best interests of the people and the country. However, looking at birth rates, demographics, education levels, income levels and so on... it's becoming more more clear that the majority will soon become uneducated people. Let me be clear here, by uneducated I mean, people who cannot understand what is actually best for them and the country. If democracy continues to exist, there is no defense against dumb people electing leadership that will ruin the country. These dumb people will have a greater say then the smart people and as a result, will eventually cause the demise of democracy. Take Gaza for example. Hamas was democratically elected. Now to a level-headed person they probably wouldn't want to elect a political party that is willing to sacrifice it's own people, to fulfill a political agenda. However in Gaza the majority of the people voted for Hamas, and as a result they were elected. To me, this is an example of democracy failing. When leadership that destroys it's country is elected by a majority of people who believe said leadership is best for them, simply because they are not educated or wise enough to understand the consequences of the leadership that they elected. This is just one example. I believe that in order for society to evolveexist we cannot put our faith in the people. I believe that we must be ruled by the elites of our societies. These elites are not selected by the people, but are established based on certain merits. Merits that are achieved through Humanitarian work, educational work, military work.. ect. Sort of like the Supreme Court, but without the appointment by a president. The appointment shall be made by qualifications that limit the representation to a handful of people. To me, this is the only way to protect people from themselves. If you believe that Democracy won't fail, I ask what makes you believe that there will be enough smart people to outweigh the dumb people? Using statistics of birth rates, education levels, income levels, wouldn't you agree that lower society is the one reproducing at higher rates? Possibly because they aren't bright enough to understand the financial, personal physical burdens having many kids cause. Wouldn't you feel more comfortable putting your faith in the hands of honest, educated, competent people, then a majority that is lacking most of those things? I say Democracy is doomed, and it's becoming clearer by the day. Change My View Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

       " Document(page_content='Memories can be compared to footprints left in the sand. Easily imprinted and cemented forever into the sands of time, memories are cherished throughout a lifetime. For those with Alzheimer\\'s Disease, these memories are more like those that are washed away by the tide, erased from existence in the simple rush of water. While volunteering at a nursing home for those with Alzheimer\\'s, I learned that these memories those that are the most deeply imprinted beneath the surface, with the potential to enthrall and touch the lives of anyone who has the privilege to experience them. Completely out of my comfort zone, I walked into the nursing home and glanced around to see elderly men in suspenders and grandmothers with hair spun of white silk. My first thought was, \"how am I supposed to carry on a conversation with a person that is not only a stranger, but may not even fully comprehend some of their comments?\" Pushing myself to throw my inhibitions aside, I became engaged multiple conversations and eventually the discussion circled to my Abercrombie camp; Fitch sweatshirt, which was deemed to be \"such a pretty color for a young girl.\" Smiling to myself, I began to realize how easy the chatter flowed between us, not even noticing the 3 men that had pulled up chairs behind us, joking amongst them. As the night came to a close, I walked along the hallway with one of the residents, who informed me that he was once part of the Marines, responsible for jumping out of planes and helicopters during conflict. I stopped and gaped at the elderly man in the pageboy cap whom I was walking down the hallway with, completely taken aback and at a loss for words. I had never imagined such an exciting and dangerous past for a man now in an Alzheimer\\'s home! He also began to tell tales of his friends at the home: the former French model, Steelers football player, and secretary at the White House. Now, I was completely shocked out of my mind. I had walked into the nursing home expecting to glance at the clock every 2 minutes and force a smile as I volunteered amongst whom I had expected to be cranky old ladies and grumpy men, burdened by an Alzheimer\\'s diagnosis. I left with a light heart and a mind spinning with stories of the glamorous Parisian fashion world and army life of decades past. Furthermore, I no longer felt as much sadness for the ones plagued by a disease, because I realized the meaning and power that memories have for us. As Faulkner once said, \"The past is never dead, it is not even past.\" Even once memories are erased, the past still remains in the mind, the way that footprints leave their mark forever after the waves have washed away the surface.'),\n",

Leave it to the professionals!\" \"If you hate it that much, I don\\'t see you helping!\" I snap back at him. He shrugs, and drinks more of my coffee. I just sigh and keep painting the table. \"Blood splatter\\'s wrong,\" he comments, pulling his hood tighter over his head. I suppose even Death felt the cold. I make a little unappreciative groan and spread the blood around with the heel of my hand. \"You know, most people beg to not die. What\\'re you doing all this for?\" Death puts down the cup of coffee and tosses his scythe from hand to hand, clearly bored. Not bored enough to leave me be, though. The last ten minutes since he\\'d materialized in the middle of the room had been incessant complaining about how bad I was making him look. \"Borrowed too much money,\" I explain, hitting the table with a candlestick to provide signs of a struggle. Death nods approvingly. \"I\\'d prefer to take my chances on the road than with the mafia.\" \"Right, well,\" he taps his scythe on the floor twice. I expected something to happen, but he just uses the scythe to pull himself to his feet. \"I suppose I could help a little.\" Death holds up a withered hand, the other pointing his scythe at the door. His fingers count down, 5..... 4..... \"Should I be concerned?\" I ask him. \"Hush,\" he reprimands. A chill runs down my spine like I\\'d watched a video of swarming spiders, or a stampede of elephants ran over my grave. He reaches one, and a heavily tattooed, burly man bursts through the door, raising a nasty looking knife. I stagger backwards, as the entity which had haunted me for the last few months finally took physical form. Then Death swooshes his scythe, and the man falls to the floor, choking and thrashing relentlessly. \"Oh, uh, thanks Death,\" I glance from the couch to the gradually dying man by my front door. \"No, no, not at all,\" he walks over to the burly corpse. With remarkable strength for his scrawny frame, he lifts the body and tosses it onto the table. It\\'s like watching an artist at work. I couldn\\'t see his face through the hood, and he said nothing, but the way he moved hinted at the absolute focus required. He handled blood and bone like a painter and a chef combined into a single, morbid art. \"Ah, I forgot how wonderful it is to work. You know, most of the time I\\'m just choking people with tacos, or pushing them down stairs,\" he says, waving his hands around. The scene in front of him is altered accordingly, tables flipping over as he handles the body like a ragdoll. \"There\\'s nothing to work with!\" \"Alright,\" he plucks a hair off my head. \"I\\'m changing his blood type and whatnot. You\\'ll have a couple of weeks to get away.\" \"I, uh, thank you, Death,\" I smile awkwardly.

Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.**  \\n  \\nThe majority of companies regard that they should create regulation about how their employee dress while others more focus on their working performance than worker's dress code. This essay will discuss two points of view regarding such issue.  \\n  \\nOn the one hand, the workers should well-dressed when they work in departments where they meet many people whether they came from inside or outside of a company. Those who work in marketing department have to dress properly when they have discussion with potential customers or investors as a measure to show company's professionality. Although the stakeholders are not familiar with the culture of the company, they know about that trough how the employees behave and prepare their appearance. As a result, employee's manner will help the industry to create a good image and increase its reputation.  \\n  \\nOn the other hand, people who are employed as an accountant and spend most of the time on the desk should concern more on their performance although the appearance comes into the play. During working, they do not interact with their members unless it is really needed. Because of that, they tend to focus on duty and avoid a crowded situation which can distract their concentration. Consequently, they are not required to notice their dress-code since it is not important indicator which contributes most to their performance while their quality of work is above all.  \\n  \\nIn conclusion, while some argue that employees who well-dressed can increase company's image and others tend to choose the quality of work as the key successful factor of a company. In my personal opinion, I believe that both aspects are essential aspects which cannot be separated\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='A Tale of Two Cities: A Balanced Portrayal of the French Revolution Analytical Essay\\n\\nA Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens is one of Dickens most tragic works. The novel is set in the time before and during the French Revolution. The story revolves around Lucie Manette, a young Frenchwoman living in London and her family and friends. Lucie is loved by a British lawyer Sydney Carton and French expatriate Charles Darney, whom she marries.\\n\\nDarney is of a noble French family and gets in trouble with the French revolutionaries on a trip to France to rescue an old family servant. The novel paints a vivid picture of the French Revolution, the fervor and radicalism of the revolutionaries and the terror and bloodshed spread by the revolutionaries.\\n\\nHowever A Tale of Two Cities is not a rabidly anti-revolutionary and pro-monarchy sort of work unlike, for example, The Scarlet Pimpernel. Dickens makes the causes of the revolution clear through his vivid portrayal of the corrupt and brutal aristocracy which dominated the monarchical government prior to the revolution.\\n\\nDickens portrays the corrupt nature of the old order primarily through the various acts of cruelty perpetrated by the Charles Darnay뗩 father and his uncle the Marquis St. Evr칠monde. Due to them Dr. Alexandre Manette, Lucie뗩 father, is arrested and secretly kept in prison for eighteen years, where he loses his mind (Dickens 54).\\n\\nIt is revealed that the Marquis killed a peasant and kidnapped his wife, with whom he had become infatuated. He also killed the wife뗩 brother and of her family, only one little sister survived.\\n\\nDr. Manette was imprisoned in order to prevent him from exposing the crime (Dickens 383). The Marquis St. Evr칠monde runs over a peasant뗩 child while driving in his carriage, killing him. The Marquis is not much bothered by what has just occurred a just tosses a gold coin at the child뗩 father as compensation (Dickens 123).\\n\\nThe corrupt state of the old regime can also be seen in the disgust with which Charles Darnay, one of the heroes of the novel, regards his inheritance (Dickens 141).\\n\\nWhile Dickens seems to agree that the old French order was corrupt and that the ruling class deserved to be removed, he does not agree with the radicalism and extremism of the French revolutionaries. He portrays the revolution as starting from a justified anger; events like the murder of Marquis St. Evr칠monde by Gaspard, the father of the child who the Marquis ran over in his carriage provide early signs of the coming violence against the upper class (Dickens 212).\\n\\nHowever, once the revolution occurs, Dickens sympathies with the rebels ends and he portrays them as irrational fanatics out to kill any member of the aristocracy who they can get their hands on, regardless of whether that person has committed any injustice against the peasantry in the past or not.\\n\\nA central character in the depiction of the madness of the revolution is Madame Defarge. The Defarges are old servants of Dr. Manette and seem, in the beginning to recognize their debt to him. They shelter him when he is released from prison.\\n\\nHowever Madame Defarge뗩 hatred for the aristocracy is so intense that she has her old benefactor뗩 son-in-law condemned to be executed and wishes to have his daughter and little granddaughter killed as well, so that the bloodline is completely wiped out (Dickens 313).\\n\\nLooking at the novel from a holistic perspective, it seems right to say that A Tale of Two Cities portrays the French Revolution in an evenhanded manner. The evil and corruption of the old regime is made clear and the fanaticism and extremism that characterize the new order are portrayed as well.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nDickens, Charles.

She is the shame of the family, Mr. Compton declared, and she will not sully the Compton name further. Moral decay certainly is a prominent feature in William Faulkner\\'s \"The Sound and the Fury,\" but I find this decadence and corruption offers a much more optimistic lesson.

I feel pity for Quentin who, in spite of noble goals of sacrificing himself to preserve his sister Candace\\'s deteriorating social stance, is driven to madness and suicide. These themes may not seem optimistic, but I must look mindfully on them. As indicated by the Compton trait of self-deterioration, I have learned that success does not hinge upon resources or social-status; that I must make success my own through inexorable willpower. It seems driven by schadenfreude that I find happiness from these devastating circumstances, that, indicated by the noble characters of Candace and Quentin\\'s downfall, good-nature does not reciprocate happiness.

When I say everywhere, I mean it: in my hair, intertwined in the reticulations of my carpet, caught in the rivets of my jeans, and, I am pretty sure, stuck behind my molars. I was putting a band-aid on a finger pricked by a needle too swift for even my cat-like reflexes to dodge when I glanced at my limbless clay sculpture. At that moment, I realized I had gone crazy; instead of working on a sculpture due in just two weeks for an art exhibition, I sat in a pile of cut-up felt and fur, making a Giants\\' bomber hat. Although I have loved the San Francisco Giants ever since I tasted my first \"J.T. Snow Cone\" from a ballpark food stand, this season I was the epitome of a zealot. My transformation from fan to fanatic began during a midnight car ride with my father early in the season. He, for the third time that week, went off about how much he wanted the Giants to win the World Series. I immediately tuned out until, seemingly out of nowhere, he told me that he was scheduled for another liver biopsy. \"What\\'s wrong?\" I demanded.\" The doctors don\\'t know. That\\'s why I want to see the Giants win; I may not get another chance t-\"\"Stop! Can you please stop?\"\" Sheryl, you\\'re always so stressed. Life is short; simple as that. I could be here five years, or ten or fifty. But you don\\'t know what will happen-no one does and no one can. So right now, I want the Giants to win it all.\" I sat there a moment before I told him I loved him, and we drove home in silence. My father taught me how to keep a game face during the most intense volleyball games, how to install a radio in a \\'69 Stingray, and how to figure out which shoe goes on which foot, but this was the best lesson of all: you don\\'t know what will happen. Each moment must be cherished, even if it is just a smile after a home run or a spoonful of an overpriced snow cone with a pun for a name. It seems foolish to spend years hoping a baseball team would win. The moments created by this hope, though, are the ones I will cherish for years to come: ice-cream after a win, tears after a loss, and perhaps most of all, post-game car rides with my dad, talking about baseball but always drifting off into our dreams and wishes and fears. These moments make big accomplishments worthwhile; the World Series means nothing to me without the foolishness of giving a high-five to the smelly man in the bleachers behind me or the childish elation of jumping on my bed. My high school endeavors amount to nothing without the hot chocolate breaks between late-night studying and games of slap-jack after endless days of testing. This baseball season shaped my dreams in ways I never expected; I now understand that small details make big differences and seemingly insignificant moments can create the most significant memories. I aspire to always cherish details, to be the babysitter who remembers the preschooler\\'s favorite crayon and the daughter who calls just to say \"I love you.\" I do not know what will happen in my life, but as long as I make the most of every moment, no obstacle will seem too crushing, no blow either devastating, and no goal too ambitious. So thank you, San Francisco Giants, thank you.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Sexuality According to Playboy Essay\\n\\nHefner defines Playboy as a kind of a triumph of female sexuality. However, it is wrong to believe that the opinions of one group of people should influence the creation of other opinions. Each person has a unique understanding of an idea and should share it using personal experience, knowledge, and interests. Still, sexuality should not be confused with sex itself. In comparison to the latter, sexuality is something created by a person but dependent on a society and limited by means of certain norms.\\n\\nPlayboy experience proves that sexuality may be of a double nature: egocentric and beneficial for the women, who are able to use their own ambitions, bodies, and talents to achieve their goals and become famous, or sacrificial and immoral for the women, who find it obligatory to follow the rules and make their bodies appropriate for the standards instead of using their opportunities to create the new ones.\\n\\nSexuality is defined as the way of how people are able to experience themselves as sexual beings and show the others the things that can prove that the chosen experience is deserved to be called sexual. Anyway, sexuality has to correspond to a number of issues to be properly defined by a society and gain the necessary portion of power. In her book, Kathryn Leigh Scott admits that 랓ou soon start to realize how great the power of a woman뗩 sexuality is  and how youre using it (110).\\n\\nIt becomes clear that Playboy women are free to use their abilities in any possible ways just to achieve the desirable goal and attract someone뗩 attention. Unfortunately, Scott뗩 experience is not the only one to rely on. For example, people, who observe the life of Playboy girls from the inside and evidence how their sexuality is born, say that a number of challenges and sacrifices should be overcome to find out a true power of sexuality. Some girls cannot even understand how priceless their numerous concessions can be. They just accept what is given to them as a unique chance to become known and refuse the fact that they are the victims of their sexuality and the expectations of other people concerning their sexuality.\\n\\nIn general, sexuality is a complex issue that cannot be provided with certain explanations. People have to know about its existence and its guile that come along with its power and unexplained influence on people.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nScott, Kathryn.

       " Document(page_content='History: the First Nation People Essay\\n\\nDemographic shifts and political changes played a critical role in shaping the social status of the First Nation people. Most of the historical events took place during the 19th century.\\n\\nIt is prudent for the Crown to get back to the roots of the challenges facing the First Nation people instead of merely relying on the legislative agenda of the Canadian parliament. From the early beginning, the First Nation people believed that the government was mandated to perform certain roles on their behalf.\\n\\nImportant rulings made by the Canadian Supreme Court are largely not in favor of the First Nation people. The fiduciary principles in place are apparently not clear in regards to the aspirations of the aboriginal people. Needless to say, consulting the First Nation people should not be perceived as a privilege to this group since they also have their constitutional rights and freedoms.\\n\\nThe issue of land as a major resource of the aboriginal people has been a controversial subject for long. Whereas the Supreme Court boasts of being a chief law interpreter in the country, the aboriginals are yet to enjoy the benefits of most rulings made by this court. The aboriginals have always claimed that they do not have express rights to some of their resources.\\n\\nIt is the fiduciary duty of the Crown to investigate and act on the recommendations of such claims. For example, the Nechako River in British Columbia triggered a lot of conflict between the First Nation people and the Canadian government during the 1950s. The government built a major hydroelectric dam across this river without consulting the aboriginal people.\\n\\nThe group claimed that their source of livelihood was significantly affected since the river was their only source of fishing and other daily upkeep activities. An effective dispute resolution mechanism should be adopted in such cases.\\n\\nBetter still, the government of Canada was supposed to make prior consultations with the First Nation people even before planning the construction of the dam. Unfortunately, similar disregards have been taking place for several decades in the presence of a functional judiciary.\\n\\nIn 2004, the Supreme Court made a landmark ruling on the Haida Nation v. British Columbia case. According to the contents of the case, the Crown was supposed to either concur or refute that it had full knowledge of the rights and freedoms of the First Nation people. A constructive knowledge was also supposed to be considered in the contents of the case. Second, the contemplated conduct of the Canadian government by that time was also queried.\\n\\nFinally, it was asserted that the claim of right by the First Nation people was highly likely to be affected by the contemplated behavior of the Crown. The three elements adopted in the Supreme Court proceedings were a clear illustration that the Canadian government was not sincerely interested in the constitutional rights and freedoms of the aboriginal people.\\n\\nAs it stands now, major strides have already been made in regards to the consultation role of the fiduciary. It is vital to understand that consultation is a constitutional process and not merely a matter of legislation.\\n\\nConsultation should also seek a compromise between the concerned parties. In other terms, the interests of both the aboriginals and the Crown should be catered for whenever a compromise is reached during the process of consultation.\\n'),\n",

References\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nTop strengths and emotional intelligence can be used to a great benefit in the workplace, as well as in private life. The Values in Action Inventory of Strengths test can give a person an idea of what their most powerful characteristics are, even when they are not aware of them. By properly utilizing them, the person could achieve a much better work experience and performance. Emotional intelligence is more focused on different types of awareness and management that come with analysis and understanding of the actions of a person and their surroundings. This paper will analyze three different cases that concern these concepts.\\n\\nThe Cases\\n\\nThis case presents a scenario where a manager named Susan, believes that her strengths would not be useful in her work life and thinks about keeping her workflow the same as it was before. The strengths that the test gave her were 랃umor and 랎eamwork. Despite her initial choice of ignoring those results, I would recommend considering a different approach. Dr. Martin Seligman suggests that in cases where the application of the strengths is not obvious, the person should try to use them while performing their lease favorite work task.\\n\\nThis could help her improve her workflow. Perhaps she could use teamwork to organize a small team to help her complete these tasks. She could also try to find a brighter side of her least liked tasks through joking about them (Seligman, 2009).\\n\\nThe second scenario showcases Harold who just got an MBA from Harvard. He is a motivated worker and is planning to be a CEO before he turns 45. His networking skills are impeccable, but employees see his actions as self-motivated and only beneficial to him, instead of the company. This description suggests that while he is good at interacting with the people who can advance his career, his emotional intelligence is low, as he lacks social awareness, relationship management, and some crucial parts of self-management. His self-awareness could be high, however, as he is very self-confident and must have good self-assessment because his networking skills have gained him great benefits so far (Tearle, 2014).\\n\\nThe third case presents a situation where the manager named Carl is great at understanding his employees, but unfortunately, he often takes every issue very personally. This is starting to affect his work because he had to take a few days off after a fall in profitability. This case suggests that Carl has very high levels of social awareness, and social skills, but still needs to work on his self-management and self-awareness. It is clear that Carl is not aware of his emotions and has no control over them which suggests a need for further improvement (Sterrett, 2000).\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nEmotional intelligence and the top strengths defined by the VIA test can be a powerful tool. However, they should be properly utilized to gain their full potential. As these cases suggest, a lack of one aspect may bring detriments even in situations where other aspects are very well developed, especially in cases of Carl and Harold. Both of these people have a certain level of emotional intelligence, but it is not balanced properly and is leading to negative outcomes for their teams and organizations. All four aspects should be balanced for the full effect of EI to be seen.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nSeligman, M. (2009). Dr. Martin Seligman뗩 top strengths . Web.\\n\\nSterrett, E. (2000).

People have always been interested in their history, in the life before them and other events, which were very important for some time. Before historians began to record the events before ancient authors or chroniclers wrote their works some myths were told from one generation till the other one and in such a way ancient myths came to our times. Different countries have different myths, different Gods, and Goddesses, and it can be very informative to compare the myths of different countries and to define their differences and similarities.\\n\\nTheseus is a Greek hero who is famous not only for his character or some features but for his achievements. Being wise, Theseus managed to be a great ruler. He was also very powerful, as to the way of his ruling he stepped a lot of miles and managed to take part in a lot of struggling, such as the slew of Periphetes giant, the killing of robber Sinis, also the murder of Crommyon and Cercyon, who were cruel and negative characters in the Greek mythology. The name of Theseus is closely connected with the famous myth about Minotaur, when going for a fight with a great monster, Theseus promised to raise a white flag if the affair were successful and to ask the team of the board to raise a black flag in Theseus were dead. Returning from Crete with the victory, the feeling of delight made him forget to change the flag from black to white and Theseus뗩 father killed himself thinking about his son뗩 death (Scull, 2003).\\n\\nHorus is the Egyptian mythological God, who is famous for his appearance, and to be more concrete for the variety of his appearances. His usual look is a human뗩 body with the head of a hawk or falcon. The most famous story connected with Horus is his battle with Seth, who was the spirit of darkness. Their fight symbolized the battle between light and darkness, day and night, good and evil. Horus was considered a winner, but Seth remained alive, as the battle may be considered unfinished. Horus remained in the sky and was the king, and Seth became the God of the storm who disturbs people (Andrews, 2000).\\n\\nThese myths have both differences and similarities, which show that despite different traditions and understanding of the world, people had the same vision of a lot of things from different countries. The understanding of life and death, good and evil, the fights with monstrous and other evil creatures, where the good part always wins are similar issues which present in the myths of Greek and Egyptian nations. The situations and the way of battle providing are different (Egyptians are crueler). The outcomes various, Greek myth is rather pessimistic.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Greece and Egypt are very ancient civilizations, which existed when most of the countries even were not planned to appear on the world map and the myths are the most numerous there. The difference in the countries traditions, customs, understanding of the world, and other aspects in their histories made their myths different, but still, the same features also exist, such as unnatural power or abilities, the understanding of good and bad, and the usual good victory in these battles.\\n\\nReference List\\n\\n 1.

First, a PAD method operating in an open-set mode, capable of correctly discerning 100 of fake thermal samples, achieving Attack Presentation Classification Error Rate (APCER) and Bona-Fide Presentation Classification Error Rate (BPCER) equal to 0, which can be easily implemented into any existing system as a separate component. Second, a hand biometrics system operating in a closed-set mode, that has PAD built right into the recognition pipeline, and operating simultaneously with the user-wise classification, achieving rank-1 recognition accuracy of up to 99.75. We also show that thermal images of the human hand, in addition to liveness features they carry, can also improve classification accuracy of a biometric system, when coupled with visible light images. To follow the reproducibility guidelines and to stimulate further research in this area, we share the trained model weights, source codes, and a newly created dataset of fake hand representations with interested researchers. footnote Paper accepted for the BTAS 2018 Special Session on Image and Video Forensics In Biometrics, 22-25 Oct, 2018, Los Angeles, USA\"),\n",

Concrete jungle where dreams are made of! There\\'s nothing...,\" please do not mind that, my mind often oversteps its boundaries and enters the page. Hmm, my intellectual vitality?

I feel that the idea of freedom of thought, and an almost randomness of thought within one\\'s mind enhances their ability to solve problems. Consistency is dry and rigid. Spontaneity is flexible and useful. Which, I suppose transitions nicely to a discussion about my intellectual development. I see life as a disjointed quilt of events and experiences. It is refractory, uneven, and dynamic. Why must my thoughts be any different? If this universe can operate under entropy, why must my mind conform to order? \"We could not, for example, arrive at a principle like that of entropy without introducing some additional principle, such as randomness, to this topography.\" Ah, take that tangent so candidly stated by Michael Poland. Life is random, and this quality is thus the source of my intellectual inspiration. \"Is mayonnaise an instrument?\" Perhaps not. And perhaps that completely random statement is a useful instrument of emphasis in this essay. Maybe this glimpse into my mind has answered your questions: Spontaneity is the food of my intellect. Thus, I actively and openly use that force. I think with an intention to solve, but I let the elements that spring around me lead to the solution, in whatever way that may be. Well, what do you know?

       " Document(page_content='Credibility as an Essential Leadership Quality Report\\n\\nCredibility is one of the most important qualities of leadership. Credibility refers to the ability to win trust or to be believed by the followers in an organization. It is the ability to convince followers that the path taken by the leader is the right path that would yield the desired results. Credibility has two components which are expertise and trustworthiness. For a leader to be considered as a credible person, he or she must be an expert in the field he or she leads. He must also be considered as a person who can be trusted with resources of the organization and with the people.\\n\\nThe most engaging moments for me in this week뗩 topic\\n\\nThis week뗩 topic was very engaging, especially on issues about generating trust. As was mentioned above, credibility has two components of expertise and trustworthiness. Most leaders are scoring high on expertise, especially with the emergent of many institutions of higher learning. However, trustworthiness still remains a challenge. It was very engaging to learn how large organizations such as Lehman Brothers were brought to their knees due lack of trustworthiness among the management.\\n\\nThe moment I felt most distanced from what was happening in this week뗩 course\\n\\nIn this week뗩 course, I felt distanced by time which was taken to discuss this topic. Although this course is very important in preparing learners to be credible people when they become leaders, the time taken to learn it was relatively short as compared to other week뗩 courses. I felt that the understanding of this course would have been better if more time were to be dedicated.\\n\\nActions of others that I found most affirming or helpful in this week뗩 course\\n\\nIt was reassuring that the tutor was keen to teach all the important factors of credibility in leadership within the limited time available. The tutor appreciated that the time was limited, and as such, was keen to use the available time in the best way possible to ensure that learners got the right information. The learners were also sensitive on the issue of time and tried avoiding any issues of time wastage. This helped in making this week뗩 course a success despite the limitation of time.\\n\\nThe most surprising moment for me in this week뗩 course\\n\\nIn this week뗩 course, it was surprising to learn that credibility goes beyond trust. It is surprising to know that for a leader to be considered credible, he must not only demonstrate trustworthiness but also ability to offer expert leadership in the area he or she is entrusted with. This means that such a leader must be capable to undertake activities that others consider technically beyond their scope. It is through this that followers will believe in him or her.\\n\\nWhat I would do differently if this week of the course could be re-lived\\n\\nIf this week뗩 course were to be re-lived, I would try to engage the current leaders to understand their views about credibility in leadership. I would visit the selected leaders within the first day of the week after getting the outline of the week뗩 course. With this information, it will be possible to try and compare what is learnt theoretically in class, and what is practically on the ground. This will enhance understanding this aspect of leadership from both theoretical and practical perspectives.\\n'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Aristotelian Dreams Theory and Modern Oneirology Essay\\n\\nAristotelian Theory of Dreams\\n\\nDreams and dreaming have been the point of discussion in philosophy and psychology since as far back as the Hellenic times. At that, Aristotle, the most prominent student of Plato뗩, is credited as the genius to build the foundation for the modern psychology of sleep. Despite the fact that Aristotle mainly relied on the knowledge of his time in his descriptions, he explained the basics of dreaming in the terms that are widely accepted to-date.\\n\\nBeing by nature a person with a thirst for empirical knowledge, Aristotle had a prolific scientific career and wrote 170 works in 40 years (Hunt, 2007, p. 30). Among those that have survived up to the present, his theory of sleep stands out. Although he was mistaken in his assumption that a person only had dreams during deep sleep, his contribution set a direction for further studies in this field. Most obviously, he allocated the non-divine nature of dreams and the fact that dreams did not predict the future.\\n\\nFurther, he stated that a person뗩 dreams were affected by the experiences they had during the day. Importantly, Aristotle maintained that some non-significant impressions were likely to pass unnoticed when the intellect was in full function during the day and subsequently manifest themselves during the nighttime (Windt, 2015).\\n\\nThe discovery of diverse stages of sleep, particularly rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, changed the Aristotelian understanding of the process. As said, his assumption that dreams only occurred in deep sleep was wrong: most vivid dreams are likely to happen in REM sleep, which is superficial (Windt, 2015). Another change of Aristotle뗩 paradigm brought by the discovery of REM sleep was the attitude towards sleeping. Aristotle described sleep as a helpless state of deafness to the world.\\n\\nThis negative attitude was followed by other philosophers up to the 1950s. The discovery of REM sleep stopped the radical division of sleep and wakefulness, defining dreaming as the third state of mind (Windt, 2015). Thus, it would be true to say that many of Aristotelian conceptions were abandoned with the development of psychology. On the other hand, there are several aspects due to which his theory is relevant today.\\n\\nWhen Aristotle tried to answer just how a person can see dreams when their vision is not functioning, he established the involvement of three intrapsychic concepts: sense-perception, consciousness, and imagination, regarding the first one as fundamental (Ierodiakonou, 2011, p. 51). Perceived by the senses, the images were propagated into the consciousness, as stated above. The consciousness acting together with imagination, as per Aristotle, retrieved the extruded experiences into the canvas of the dream.\\n\\nToday, psychology accepts sense-perception as the ultimate cause of dreams. In addition, the process of propagation of, so to say, unimportant daily experiences and further retrieval of them into the dreams have become known as repression into the unconscious in psychoanalysis (Ierodiakonou, 2011, p. 53). Finally, and most interestingly, he seemed to foresee the transmission of neuron signals, with his idea of propagation easily paralleled to excitation between the neurons. Consequently, Aristotle뗩 works have laid the basis for a variety of study fields, particularly psychology.\\n\\nTo conclude, Aristotelian genius was able to perceive and operate the intrapsychic concepts at the foundation of the sciences. His theory of dreams, despite excusable errors, still serves as a basis for the modern oneirology and psychology of dreaming.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nHunt, M. (2007). The Story of Psychology (2nd ed.).

       " Document(page_content='Human and Social Capital: Job Performance Report (Assessment)\\n\\nValues and attitudes in the organizational behavior\\n\\nThe organizational behavior concepts that appeal to me are those of human and social capital, personal attitudes, and job satisfaction. The human and social capital influence job performance and career opportunities (Kinicki & Fugate, 2015). My business organization뗩 efficiency consists of investing in my experience, education, and skills, together with the relationships and status I have. It will contribute to the success of my company.\\n\\nThe effectiveness of my current company is partially based on the concept of job satisfaction. I consider it one of the major workplace attitudes. If the employees are satisfied with their work conditions, process, and results, they do their best to complete the tasks. I think the company should pay more attention to the bonuses for excellent work to improve the motivation and job satisfaction.\\n\\nAs for the company뗩 effectiveness, I would suggest the example of Alston & Bird. The managers wanted to stimulate the employees after the great recession. They let people express their opinions and tried to meet their needs. Thus they showed an excellent personal attitude to the employees and expected the corresponding feedback. Although such an approach may be effective, the company should better plan and predict their activities to avoid further recessions.\\n\\nI am planning to study the Google corporation as an object of my final paper. It is a company that gives a lot of personal attitudes닶his attitude influences behavior. The company celebrates the holidays, provides unusual and comfortable workplaces. It looks more interested in the workers than in the customers, thus contributing to job satisfaction. As a result, satisfied workers are more productive.\\n\\nTo interview the person for this course, I might ask about workplace evaluation.\\n\\nIndividual Differences and Managing Diversity\\n\\nSpeaking of Individual Differences and Emotions and Social Perception and Managing Diversity chapters, I would choose the following organizational behavior concepts. In these chapters, Kinicki and Fugate (2015) speak about the important differences, the influence of personality on the effectiveness, and the core self-evaluation.\\n\\nAs for my current company, I find the concept of individual differences most applicable. The employees are different, and so are the customers. We should not be scared of the differences. On the contrary, we can learn something new from the people that are not like us.\\n\\nMy company gives attention to the personality of the workers. It is believed that personality influences performance. The combination of appearance, thoughts, actions, and feelings make a personality. Thus, the correct measurement of a personality when hiring someone is the key to success.\\n\\nSpeaking of self-evaluation, we can mention Sara Blakely, the founder of Spanx. She is the youngest woman billionaire who faced both failures and success on her way to the top (Kinicki, & Fugate, 2015). She had various jobs before she found her place. Her self-efficiency and the ability to evaluate herself brought her where she is.\\n\\nGetting back to Google, the company I am going to study for my final paper, I would like to analyze the concept of important differences. The company realizes that the employees are varied and do not put any strict limitations. I think this is the concept for further development, for the diversity gives birth to bright ideas.\\n\\nWhen I interview a person for this course, I would ask about the influence of personality on work performance.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nKinicki, A., & Fugate, M.

       " Document(page_content='The Debate Over Gay Rights in American Politics Essay\\n\\nThe debate over gay rights is one of the most controversial subjects in American politics today.\\n\\nOver the last decade, gays have made great advances in obtaining public recognition of their lifestyle. Multiple states have passed legislation allowing for some kind of civil unions, and several states now permit gay marriage.\\n\\nJust several months ago, President Obama signed a bill allowing gays to serve openly in the military. However, these advances have not come without a backlash from some elements of society. Conservative Christian groups regard the homosexual lifestyle as immoral, and they argue that society should not treat it as an acceptable lifestyle choice.\\n\\nIn making these arguments, they point to passages from the Bible that they claim condemn homosexuality.\\n\\nProponents of gay rights vigorously dispute these interpretations, but many people on both sides of the issue do not realize that the Bible has historically been used to argue many things in the past  including things that most people today would find repugnant.\\n\\nDuring the 1800뗩 many slave owners and apologists for slavery used biblical arguments to justify the existence of the 랋eculiar institution. They pointed to passages in the Bible discussing the duty of servants to obey their masters as evidence that slavery was biblically sanctioned. Supporters of slavery also pointed to numerous mentions of slaves in both the Old and New Testaments as proof that slavery was a normal condition of mankind. This view was by no means universal  many northern abolitionists were evangelical Christians  but it served as one of the main arguments in favor of slavery until the end of the institution.\\n\\nOf course, discussing whether or not the Bible justifies slavery or gay rights is far beyond the scope of this paper. However, the comparison illustrates a point that many opponents of gay rights often fail to realize. Conservative Christians sometimes state flatly that the Bible treats homosexuality as immoral, and act as if their interpretation of the Bible settles the matter.\\n\\nHistory shows, though, that interpretations of the Bible have been used to support many causes. As the example above demonstrates, slavery is one of these causes. Many people in the 1800s claimed that the Bible condoned slavery. Virtually nobody today would make such a claim. Yet the actual words of the Bible have not changed in nearly two thousand years.\\n\\nWhat this history show is arguments based on the Bible almost always depend on those who do the interpreting. It also depends on the society and the conditions that they live in. Nearly 150 years after the end of slavery in the United States, slavery seems especially abhorrent to us. Nobody living today has actually witnessed slavery in the United States (although slavery does continue to exist in several other countries). In contrast, Southerners in the 1800s grew up with slavery as a normal part of their lives. Slavery had existed for virtually all of human history, so religious-based arguments in favor of the institution seemed plausible to some people.\\n\\nThis is also true with regard to gay rights. Polls show that people who oppose gay rights are, on average, older than the general population. These people grew up with gays being an ignored, ridiculed minority. By contrast, polls show that those who support gay rights are generally younger. These people grew up with homosexuality being a subject of discussion in politics and popular culture. Many younger people know an openly gay person. Many younger Christians believe that tolerance and acceptance of gays are mandated by the Bible. This demonstrates what the historical example of slavery indicates  that biblical interpretations usually depend on those who do the interpreting.\\n'),\n",

Changing patterns of the profession is portrayed by aging employees, gender disparity in the field, working in several clinical places, adaptation, and worries around a balance between life and work. Inside this worldwide setting, the medical services area confronts a specific emergency, with most nations on the planet revealing a deficiency of nurses (Lee & Jang, 2019). This lack antagonistically affects health frameworks globally and prompts adverse results for patients. Developing the specific connection between staff execution, the organizational culture that oversees an association, and achievement or disappointment in accomplishing its goals are needed to help nursing leaders.\\n\\nNumerous medical nurses are arriving at retirement age, and there is a decreasing inflow of new students in nursing, while demand for nursing care is expanding. The studies offer that the elements identifying with the climate and setting inside which medical caretakers work are adding to an unfriendly environment (Siket Ujv치rin칠 et al., 2020). For example, nurses burnout, work-acquired injury, and back torment are examples of quantifiable stressful consequences for wellbeing and prosperity, which are common among the nursing labor force (Siket Ujv치rin칠 et al., 2020). Nursing has been viewed as an unpleasant occupation, affecting personal satisfaction with medical nurses in one country area detailing more trouble and lower resolution levels than other expert medical services professions. In large associations, health administrations associations, numerous expert gatherings may introduce different societies. The separate parts of every subculture inside a huge association probably will not support arranged changes (Lee & Jang, 2019). Leaders who focus on expanding guidelines of care, authoritative culture, and staff conduct will be critical for the shift in care.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nLee, E., & Jang, I. (2019).

Now a days, schools policies have made it to the point where we can't use them publicly so what do we do - be sneaky. In many cases this can cause issues.

Not only can the student refuse to give up his/her cell phone; but parents may come to the school with very unkind words.\\n\\nMany things can be done to prevent this problem such as cell phones being allowed during lunch and other free times. The student body feels as though as long as they are not doing any class work then they should be able to spend their free time freely. It's doing no harm to them or anyone around them.\\n\\nStatistics show that 65% of students feel safer when they have a cell phone with them. Another poll shows that 88% of parents feel safer when they can reach there kids at all times. Lets just get to the point- it all about safety. Say something happens in the school one day, students should have a right to tell there parents; ecspecially if it's endangering their health and general well-fare. You wouldn't want parents thinking that something going on with their kid/s and they don't even know what. That could cause a lot of 'damage' to the school.\\n\\nI fully understand that students may become distracted if they know they can use their cell phones in school but that would decrease the amount of time every teacher has to take out to scold a student and confiscate his/her cell phone.

The reverbs manage to be noticeable but discrete enough not to overshadow the singer뗩 vocals and the piano.\\n\\nThere is a lot to be said about the vocal production in this song, especially given the fact that Adele is a renowned global vocalist. The vocals are the first element to be showcased in this song, and the singer sings solo in the first stanza and the chorus (ㄹdele-Hello). The first installment of harmony in this song comes in the second pre-chorus on the third bar. Background vocals are introduced to the song during the second chorus, and a repetition of some keywords makes the entire ensemble harmonious. The mixing in this song is impeccable, and it is a substantial improvement from Adele뗩 other piano-based songs. There is a smooth baseline in the song, and it appears to hold everything else together.\\n\\nWork Cited\\n\\nㄹdele-Hello. YouTube , uploaded by AdeleVEVO. 2015,\\n'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='As sickness spreads unsparingly across the nation, many schools wonder how to slow the spread of the potential plague, while continuing their students education. Distance learning is a perfect solution for this worldwide problem. I believe distance learning would be very beneficial because, it would minimize the spread of sickness, relieve stress of the students, and provide a reasonable resource for students to be responsible.\\n\\nFirst, I believe that distance learning could have a major role in stopping the spread of sickness. Every year in schools, sickness spreads through the students. Sick students chose to come to school despite being very sick because they dont want to get behind on their school work. Missing one day can create at least a week of makeup work for students depending on the intensity level of their class. So understandably these sick students decided to go to school. They then infect other students. This process is almost incurable and is a continual occurrence in every High School. However, Distance learning would provide a way for students to attend class from home. This would allow students to stay up on their work, while not infecting other students. As a much more serious sickness is seeming to infect our nation, distance learning could provide a way for all students to learn from home. This could temporarily provide health in communities, and ultimately result in a healthier nation.\\n\\nDistance learning could also be a major way to relieve the stress that students feel when they miss class. Varying reasons require students to miss class during the school year. In higher level courses, a monumental amount of work is completed in every single class. This work creates stress in students there for the class, however students that have to miss class are always much more stressed, and may spend weeks trying to make up missed work. Distance learning would allow students in various places for varying reasons to be able to connect with their class through video conferencing, or other online media to attend class. Resources and worksheets can be found on their class website. Students can print these resources and complete the work during the session, just like they were at school. This beneficial option would create a less stressed environment for students that cannot mke it to class, by allowing them to stay up to date on their work.\\n\\nDistance learning provides a reasonable resource for students to be responsible. Some may say that distance learning would diminish any responsibility students have of making up the hours they missed,\\xa0saying that this makes it easy for students to miss class. However distance learning teaches productivity to students in doing work they otherwise would have missed. Distance learning is not motivation to skip class because you have to be in the video conference during class hours, meaning you cannot be doing anything else. Distance learning provides a perfect way to dilute stress from students required to be away from class while not benefiting those who skip class. Distance learning is a excellent resource for proactive, and productive students who cannot attend class in person.\\n\\nFinally, distance learning is a very beneficial resource for all students. Distance learning relieves students from stress, but continues to challenge them in positive ways. Distance learning creates healthier communities, and provides students with good habits. Distance learning is a positive system that should be implemented in all school districts across the nation, it will ensure health, relieve stress, and teach responsibility.\\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Contraceptives in the Movie The Pill Essay\\n\\nDespite the fact that contraception as a phenomenon has been in existence for centuries, it was the introduction of the pill contraceptive that stirred a sheer outrage in the United States. While the idea of planned parenthood was understandable and acceptable at the time, the concept of a pill as the means of birth control did not sit well with the American society.\\n\\nThough the significance of the acceptance of the specified medicine is often overlooked, it is the introduction of the famous pill that was a major step forward in promoting the prochoice view on the issue and advocating women뗩 rights all over the country, as the movie The Pill shows in a very graphic way.\\n\\nWhen it comes to identifying the reasons for the unwillingness of the American society to accept the 랋ill and admit women to their right to make a choice concerning childbirth, one must mention the lack of general awareness on the topic. Indeed, as the movie shows, manifesting itself in complete lack of concept about sexual relationships in general and what these relationships may lead to in particular: There was this smoldering something that we were all supposed to know about but had no way of getting the information (The Pill 00:00:45).\\n\\nLocating the reasons for the pill to get such a negative social response from nearly the entire population of the United States, one must admit that the personal idea of purity and proper sexual behavior had little to do with the reality  in fact, it had insultingly little to do with the latter. These were the Puritanism views in the American society of the time and the what-would-the-neighbors- think attitude (The Pill 00:01:39) that defined the attitude towards the concept of childbirth control and the idea of using a pill as the key tool for it.\\n\\nThe pill, therefore, was not only the means of introducing a more careful parenthood planning system into the relationships of a husband and a wife, but also a tool for shaping the sanctimonious morals that the society of the time was powered by. Therefore, the revolutionary suggestion that Gregory Pincus came up with could be viewed as a salvation for women all over the USA.\\n\\nThough the scientist is mostly credited for promoting the idea of using the hormone progesterone as the main ingredient of a birth control pill, he, in fact, should be praised for a different kind of innovation  before Pincus came up with the idea of using the hormone for birth control, the effects of progesterone on the female body had already been known, yet, much to the researcher뗩 surprise, the GD Searle Company 랑as doing little with it (The Pill 00:20:12).\\n\\nThis does beg the question whether the prohibition of the pill, which was issued in the encyclical on the subject matter, was intended for the moral fabric of the Catholic people to remain intact, or for the church to refuse from providing women with their rights.\\n\\nThe controversy of the decision is that the Humanae Vitae 랍peaks of marriage in lyrical terms (The Pill 00:42:58), i.e., provides 라 view of sex that respects the human person (The Pill 00:43:03), yet simultaneously denies women their basic human right in making a choice in the specified domain.\\n\\nBecause of the importance of the change that the introduction of pills as contraceptives has made to the lives of millions of women all over the United States, it must be viewed as a giant step in fighting for women뗩 rights in the USA, as the movie shows rather convincingly. The movie has shown that the issue has been topical for quite a while and is not going to become any less significant any time soon. In the 21 st -century wake of the fight for human rights, though, major changes may occur to the public perception of 랎he pill.렢\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nThe Pill. PBS .

Nor was I the child who had an obsession over having sleepovers with my best friends. I was always the \"indoor kid\" who loved being in the safety of my own home. With only a few exceptions, nobody has been able to separate me from my parents for even a day. A few summers ago, my family became friends with a family from Spain and as years passed, we grew closer to them. This past summer, we met with the Spanish family in Junta Can, Dominican Republic and my summer began to twist. After spending an amusing week in paradise, my yearly family vacation came to its conclusion. As we waited for our tardy taxi to arrive, the Spanish family began asking me if I would like to go to Spain; considering school would not start for another five weeks. I apathetically said I would love to travel to Spain for a few weeks, but I knew deep down it was never going to happen because I did not want to travel without my parents. As we waited and the minutes passed, my friends would continue persuading me to travel to Spain with them, but I would kindly shift the subject. Having plenty of summer assignments to complete and college applications to begin, I would feel guilty putting off all these important tasks. The taxi arrived, and the Spanish family asked me one last time if I wanted to stay with them. I looked at my parents, and they nodded and told me I should go because not everyday I will be given this unexpected opportunity. My parents handed over my passport and money for the trip. At this point, my mind was spinning, and I felt lightheaded in a matter of seconds. My parents gave me the tightest hug I have ever received from them, and I took that opportunity to look at them and smell them knowing that it will be the last time I will be able to for two weeks. The taxi drove away and what I believed was the end of my summer was actually only the beginning. A few days later, we traveled to Madrid, Spain, and I was living my dream; traveling to a European country. I rode on the fastest train in the country and arrived at C치diz, where the family lived, which is known as the oldest city in Western Europe. My parents were not out of my mind for even a split-second. I called my parents every single day once I woke up, and before they went to bed. As much as I missed them, I was having the best summer of my young life. In a single day, I visited Gibraltar, swam in the Mediterranean Sea, and spotted Africa in the distance. Not everybody has been offered this opportunity; I am a lucky one. My summer in Spain was coming to an end, but a lot was taken out of this trip. Being without my parents for two weeks, I discovered numerous things about myself. Responsibility was a key word I put to work, as I had to be responsible towards my belongings and myself. My parents were not there telling me what I could and could not do, as I had to my own decisions. This was a time for me to reflect on everything my parents taught me throughout my life and use it in real-life situations. This summer in Spain was a fundamental learning experience that will help me with my adjustment to the college life.'),\n",

So, one day when my physics teacher informed my class about a science fair that was going to be held later that month, my two teammates and I decided to build a Tesla Coil- a device that generates very high voltages and sparks that are several inches long. Knowing that building this device could offer me an opportunity to learn a lot more than my physics textbook could offer, we embarked on the project. We scourged industrial areas for the required materials and made parts that we could not find on our own such as the capacitors, which we made using aluminum foil, glass jars and salt water. We spent about a week building the device and when we finally tested it, we were disappointed to know that it didn\\'t function properly.

       " Document(page_content='Request for Proposal for Human Services Projects Essay\\n\\nCompleting a Request for Proposal (RFP) can be a challenging but rewarding process. It is necessary to remember about major steps to undertake to make the process less stressful and more effective. Clearly, one of the first steps is to understand what kind of project the human services administrator has in mind. It is crucial to outline the project and describe it in detail (Hartmetz, 2003). To do this, the administrator has to think of any question other people may ask about the project. Clearly, all of these questions have to be answered. It is possible to see other requests for proposals as well as grants available to understand which details are crucial.\\n\\nIt is also important to implement certain research on grants available as well as agencies providing these grants. It is a good idea to start the research online. For instance, Foundation Center (2010) provides valuable tips on completing RFPs. It is possible to find links to the lists of federal and state grants. The Grants Locator system developed by eCivis Inc. also provides extensive data on federal and state grants ( Online solution eases local grant locating , 2007). The system contains evaluation of the grants, which can be very helpful for local governments as well as administrators who can get the necessary information on various grants and their attractiveness.\\n\\nThe next step is to choose the right grant and start completing the necessary forms. It is crucial to understand requirements of the agency to complete RFPs correctly. Again, online research will be helpful as the agencies provide certain guides for RFPs completion (Grants.Gov., 2010).\\n\\nApart from that, it is advisable to contact the agency and ask for the most recent information or sign up for latest updates (Foundation Center, 2010). It goes without saying that the Request for Proposal should be compiled in accordance with all the requirements of the agency. It should be detailed, concise and realistic. The project can be completed by the administrator or, if possible, it can be effective to encourage a group of people to work on it. The process should involve all people who will be working on the future project.\\n\\nClearly, completing RFPs is associated with numerous challenges. One of these challenges may be abundance of information. First, it is necessary to choose the right key words and read carefully information on the grant. It can be difficult to choose the right grant among those available as some of them may be (or, at least, seem) similar. It is important to focus on details. If there are similar grants, it is possible to write out their major peculiarities and compare major points of the grants with major aspects of the project.\\n\\nPatti (2008) notes that organizations often face issues associated with scarce resources. Thus, an administrator can understand that the organization does not have enough resources to effectively implement the project. For instance, it can lack for human resources, facilities or the necessary experience. In these cases, it is possible to collaborate with another organization to implement the project (Patti, 2008). Some fundraisers fail to carefully keep their records, which often leads to certain issues with the agency. The administrator should always remember about the importance of keeping records in a very detailed form. This will also be beneficial for the project as it will be easier to evaluate the progress and resources used.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nFoundation Center. (2010).

       " Document(page_content='The Use of Moneytree뗩 Silver Financial Planner in the Analysis of Financial Planning Essay\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n 1. Introduction\\n 2. Overview\\n 3. Conclusion\\n 4. Works Cited\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nFinancial planning is a vital skill in the planning and execution of organizational or personal objectives. The process of financial planning includes factoring in several aspects that ensure financial targets are to be achieved. Incomes, expenditure, and taxes are factors considered in the process of financial planning. This essay is going to examine the use of Moneytree뗩 Silver Financial Planner in the analysis of financial planning.\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nFrom the analysis of financial planning, we take a look into several factors such as income and expenses. The investigation of financial planning through the use of Silver Financial Planner highlights the major areas of income whereby residual income, in addition to investments, makes up total income. Financial planning relies heavily on cash flow analysis on an annual basis. The result of the cash flow analysis from Moneytree뗩 Silver Financial Planner shows that one뗩 financial plan is based upon the earning period. For instance, an individual works for a company or organization till the time of retirement. A Cash flow analysis is divided into three main sections with the first section focusing on income (Lim 61). The main sources of income for an employed individual include earned income from salary or remunerations from the organization. Savings are also factored in as income as well as pension in the case of retiring employees. We can learn from the cash flow analysis that it is prudent for an individual to have various sources of income. People with various sources of income should also keep track of their sources of income as part of the financial planning process (Hallman 44).\\n\\nIn addition to having different sources of income, an individual should keep track of his expenses. Expenses and taxes are also monitored alongside income in the process of financial planning. Expenses and taxes usually have the effect of reducing the income and, in normal circumstances; it is prudent for income to cover all the expenses and taxes. In the process of financial planning, individuals need to keep track of risks and make sure that risks taken are manageable (Lim 27). This is because risks tend to increase taxes and expenses and thus they have to be monitored closely to ensure that an individual does incur a lot of debts. Risks can be avoided through the use of several measures including taking up insurance, tax planning, or wealth accumulation (Hallman 87). Financial planning is important for many people because it helps in the creation of a savings plan. A savings plan is used by an individual during retirement or in special cases of disparities in income versus expenditure. The surplus of shortage is obtained when expenses and taxes are deducted from total income.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nFinancial planning is very important in the world today since many organizations or individuals rely on this vital procedure in the pursuit of financial freedom. The process of financial planning is a continuous process that should be undertaken regularly in the pursuit of financial freedom. Cash flow analysis is at the heart of financial planning since an individual or organization should conduct cash flow analysis frequently. The main factors in the cash flow analysis include income and expenses. Although, other external factors such as inflation, risks, and taxes could affect the income and expenditure. A prudent financial planner maintains an excess income and takes care of his risks and expenditure at an optimum level. Cash flow analysis is very important in the task of creating of savings plan or the budgeting process.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nHallman, Victor, and Rosenbloom, Jerry. Personal Financial Planning.

       " Document(page_content='This paper studies the impact of probabilistic shaping on effective signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and achievable information rates (AIRs) in a back-to-back configuration and in unrepeated nonlinear fiber transmissions. For back-to-back, various shaped quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) distributions are found to have the same implementation penalty as uniform input. By demonstrating in transmission experiments that shaped QAM input leads to lower effective SNR than uniform input at a fixed average launch power, we experimentally confirm that shaping enhances the fiber nonlinearities. However, shaping is ultimately found to increase the AIR, which is the most relevant figure of merit as it is directly related to spectral efficiency. In a detailed study of these shaping gains for the nonlinear fiber channel, four strategies for optimizing QAM input distributions are evaluated and experimentally compared in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) systems. The first shaping scheme generates a Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB) distribution based on a linear additive white Gaussian noise channel. The second strategy uses the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm to optimize an unconstrained QAM distribution for a split-step Fourier method based channel model. In the third and fourth approach, MB-shaped QAM and unconstrained QAM are optimized via the enhanced Gaussian noise (EGN) model. Although the absolute shaping gains are found to be relatively small, the relative improvements by EGN-optimized unconstrained distributions over linear AWGN optimized MB distributions are up to 59. This general behavior is observed in 9-channel and fully loaded WDM experiments.'),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Determining the Effects of Banks Privatization through Data Analysis Dissertation\\n\\nIt is important to deteermine the effects that privatization of banks have on the general public interms of whether it makes banking services better or not. To assess how individuals from different bank sectors, both private and public, view privatization in terms of efficiency of service delivery and employment creation, a sample of 30 active individuals were investigated.\\n\\nThe hypothesized scenario is that privatization is seen as a tool to increase performance/efficiency and create more employment opportunities. There was a need for carrying out a study to test this hypothesis.\\n\\nData was collected from the sample obtained so as to test the hypothesis. The data was collected through use of questionnaires which provided all the required information for the test. The data contained four different variables namely privatization (Yes/No), Efficiency (Yes/No), Employment (Yes/No) and Type (Private/Public) (Klugh, 1986).\\n\\nA regression analysis was carried out to determine if there was any relationship between privatization and efficiency. The test would hence prove whether privatization actually resulted to an increase in the efficiency of services rendered. The regression analysis produced the following output:\\n\\nRegression Analysis Output from STATA Software\\n\\nFrom the results obtained, the correlation coefficient for the test between privatization and efficiency was 3.61e-15 with a p-value of 0.000. at 5% level of significance, the p-value is greater than the critical value, 0.05.\\n\\nHence the correlation is significant and so we conclude that there is a significant correlation between privatization and efficiency. This simply means that privatization results to increased efficiency and hence should be embraced if there is a need for improvements in service delivery (Klugh, 1986).\\n\\nThe correlation coefficient for privatization and type of bank is also significant at 5% level of significance since it is less than 0.005. Hence, the type of bank, whether private of public, determines the views pertaining to whether it is important to privatize banks (Triola, 2009).\\n\\nHowever, since the correlation coefficient for privatization and employment, 0.215, is not signifiocant since it is greater than 0.05 at 5% level of significance, then there is no significant change in employment as a result of privatization of banks. This implies that privatization of banks cannot have a significant effect on the rate of employment.\\n\\nGenerally, the regression analysis has provided enough evidence to prove that the main way in which service delively by banks would be improved would be through privatization of the banks.\\n\\nSince the private sector is usually characterized by more competition and advancement in technological utilization, then there is no doubt that there is improved efficiency in thquality of services provided. Therefore, it is important for all the stakeholders to seek for more ways of ensuring privatization of banks so as to improve service delivery to customers (Triola, 2009).\\n\\nList of References\\n\\nTriola, F.(2009).

       " Document(page_content='The Storm by Kate Chopin Essay\\n\\nThe story뗩 backdrop is a storm that was about to pummel a small town. But the meat of the story is contained in the storm within the hearts of two lead characters  a man and a woman. In order to be more specific, it must be made clear that they are both married but not to each other. Calixta was the wife of Bobinot and Alcee was the husband of Clarisse. Calixta and Alcee knew each other a long time ago but as Chopin had pointed out they were now considered strangers after each went their separate ways and with their own families.\\n\\nBut it seems that Calixta and Alcee could not wipe away the memories of those years gone by when both were attracted to each other. And now, when the storm was about to hit, Calixta뗩 home was about to become like a garden and Alcee will come in like a snake tempting her and she will give in to that temptation but only until the storm is above them, when it is gone so will the storm within.\\n\\nThere are many critics who find no problem in describing what happened within Calixta뗩 home and how she succumbed to temptation. They focused on the words used by the author and made comments regarding its daring and it was too advanced for her time (Ward, p.89).\\n\\nCandace Ward, one of those who studied Chopin up close had the same verdict but just like many others she too find it difficult to explain without a shadow of doubt that indeed Calixta will continue with the affair. It is true that she gave in to her desire and invited Alcee in to his heart but it can also be said that it was a fleeting moment.\\n\\nThe author of this short story, Kate Chopin seems to have the same conclusion because at the end of the short piece she wrote that after the passing of the storm everyone was happy. On the other hand this can be interpreted to mean another thing and it is the happiness experienced by two adulterers who happen to make a connection because of the storm.\\n\\nThus, this 랃appiness has different shades of meaning (Chopin, par.5). It is different from the point of view of Bobinot the husband of Calixta because he was happy that his family is safe. It is also different from the point of view of Alcee because after the storm had passed it has been clear to him that he needed to see Calixta once again and this helps explains his letter to his wife to extend her vacation for a month or so.\\n\\nCalixta뗩 happiness is more difficult to analyze. She is happy for her husband and child뗩 safe return after the storm. She is happy being reacquainted with Alcee. But she could also be happy that the storm has ended so that Alcee could now go away. Now, whether she wanted Alcee back or not is something not easy to determine. One thing is clear; Alcee will try to find another way back to her heart.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nWhen the storm clouds gathered and the dark skies warned of imminent danger, people with wisdom tried to stay indoors. But Alcee ventured into the home of his former lover Calixta. And when she unwittingly allowed her to come into her abode she was not fully aware of what can happen next.\\n\\nAlcee tempted her by holding her close and provided protection when her husband was away. Calixta gave in like Eve who took a bite from the forbidden fruit. But it was Alcee who was ensnared, Calixta seems to forget what happened after the storm and everyone was happy. Alcee on the other hand was happy for another reason for he knew that he has a chance to sneak back into the heart of Calixta.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nChopin, Kate. The Storm.

He was sent on a mission to bust a group responsible for pirating multiple summer blockbusters. But before he could go, he had to go talk to Dr. Munchkin, the guy in charge of gadgets. \"What\\'ve you got for me this time Doc? \" , Bob asked. \"Well, here you have a standard-looking Desert Eagle,\" Dr. Munchkin said, gesturing to the aforementioned handgun, \"but, it can carry twice as much ammunition and only you can fire it\" \"Who am I? Judge Dredd? \" , Bob joked. The genius stared at him. \"Moving on,\" Dr. Munchkin said, \"this is an exploding pen, and this is a \"Yeah, yeah,\" Bob said, \"this stuff\\'s cool and all, but where\\'s the car?\" \"Very well,\" Dr. Munchkin replied, agitated, and led Bob over to a white 1965 Shelby Mustang adorned in two blue stripes, \"this beauty has a completely bulletproof exterior and a Ferrari engine. It\\'s armed with a rack of missiles behind the grill and two semi-automatic machine guns, in addition to wheel spikes for extra traction and seat warmers. Do try to return this in one piece.\" Before Dr. Munchkin could finish, Bob had already left. He arrived at a fancy party in a New York mansion. \"THIS is where the films are being pirated? \" , Bob asked, pulling out his fake I.D. He stepped into the mansion, and immediately forgot what he was doing after he saw a group of attractive women in bikinis standing next to a chocolate fountain. Five hours later, Bob awoke in bed with two redheaded supermodels, covered in chocolate. He walked over to his clothes, which were dyed brown. He escaped through the window and went to his car, where he put on a fancy suit and red bowtie. He returned to the building and wandered down into the basement, where the mansion\\'s owner, James Ferguson, was dealing cocaine and pirated copies of movies to a bunch of thugs. Instead of trying to blend in, Bob walked in and pointed his gun at Ferguson\\'s head. \"Feelin lucky, punk? \" , Bob asked. \"What do you think you\\'re doing? \" , Ferguson asked, drawing forth a gun of his own, a gilded revolver. \"I\\'m arresting you for pirating movies and dealing drugs,\" Bob said. \"How are you going to do that when you\\'re dead? \" , Ferguson asked, as a group of spandex-clad mercenaries aimed their weapons at Bob\\'s head. \"Crap,\" Bob said, as they opened fire. He fell to the ground, as red fluid leaked from his suit. As the soldiers left, Bob got up, emptying the ketchup packets from his suit. James Ferguson was escaping in a Range Rover Evoque. Bob jumped into the Mustang and began chasing him. They drove on the coast, and Bob got a clear shot at the Evoque. He flipped a switch, and the missiles fired. However, they all missed, and the mercenaries returned fire. Bob drove the Mustang closer, activating the machine guns. Bullets riddled the Evoque, as Bob narrowed the distance between them. The cars were neck and neck, giving Bob the perfect oppurtunity to accelerate. Once he was in front of the Evoque, he dropped the spike strips, which deployed and popped the Evoque\\'s tires. The car slid to a halt, and the police force showed up. Ferguson and the mercenaries were arrested. \"That\\'s what you get for pirating movies,\" Bob said, hopping into the Mustang. The End.'),\n",

These fundamental components constitute a computer system that makes a computer to run effectively. The first component is the motherboard that forms a perfect platform on which internal electronic components are attached (Miller 67).\\n\\nThe motherboard consolidates all the basic components of a computer system. All the programs and applications in a computer system are run by a component known as the central processing unit.\\n\\nIt is impossible for a computer to execute any tasks without the central processing unit (Miller 67). A computer can only boot to the operating system courtesy of the central processing unit.\\n\\nA computer system can not be complete without the storage media. The Random Access Memory commonly referred to as RAM is another fundamental component in a computer system that is responsible for storing files and information temporarily when the computer is running.\\n\\nThe size of the Random Access Memory determines how fast the computer responds to commands. A computer with a low Random Access Memory will run slowly even if it has a powerful central processing unit.\\n\\nThe other storage component in a computer system is the hard disk drive. Compared to the Random Access Memory, the hard disk drive stores data for a long time. The hard disk is able to retain the stored data and information with or without power.\\n\\nThe data in the Random Access Memory disappears the moment the computer goes off. Because of its reliability, the hard disk is used to store very important files like system files and other program files.\\n\\nThe other components include the power supply unit that is responsible for powering the computer system and the video card that is essential in displaying images. The graphics card makes the images and pictures appearing on the computer monitor to look clear and detailed (Pearsons 53).\\n\\nThere are various ways in which the computer interacts with users on a daily basis. The user interacts with the computer system through the input and output devices. A combination of software and hardware form what is normally referred to as the user interface.\\n\\nThe software enables the monitor to display the output on the computer monitor (Pearsons 53). The computer system receives input from users through hardware devices like the mouse, keyboard, joystick, game controller, touch screen and other peripherals. These input devices are referred to as peripherals because they are externally attached to the computer system.\\n\\nAfter processing the input in relation to the specified command, the user receives output from the computer system via output devices. Some of the output hardware includes the monitor and the printer.\\n\\nHuman-computer interaction requires the user to be well equipped with the relevant computing skills and knowledge to be able to navigate the computer system effectively.\\n\\nThe user is required to have some basic knowledge in computer operating systems, computer graphics, programming, database management and computer hardware technology. The computer is very useful in the sense that it helps human beings to process and store their data in a much simpler way.\\n\\nComputer applications such as the internet and computer games have enhanced human- computer interactions by necessitating information retrieval, electronic commerce and entertainment.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nMiller, Michael.

       " Document(page_content='Proto-Renaissance and Its Most Important Examples Essay\\n\\nThe renaissance period does not have a beginning; however, proto-renaissance represents the period that marked the early onset of the era. During this time, Giotto, who is considered the father of Western painting, became famous for his innovation in fresco painting. The most remarkable of his works is found in the painting work that he did in the Arena Chapel.\\n\\nThe Chapel was constructed by Enrico Scrogveni, a rich man during this time (Tomei, 2017). Enrico had the Chapel built to gain redemption of his father, who was accused of the sin of usury during the time when he was alive. Giotto was, therefore, commissioned by Enrico to paint the Arena Chapel. Giotto stepped away from the medieval spiritual painting and brought his innovative aspect of the new style of frescoes.\\n\\nThe frescoes on the walls of the Chapel tell the stories of Christ and the Virgin Mary. Giotto used the frescoes cycle to transmit the narratives of the life of Christ and the Virgin Mary. The technique of using the frescoes to paint the inside walls of the Chapel was a mastermind. The materials used for the fresco cycles were unique, and the paintings had to be completed from top to bottom (Tomei, 2017).\\n\\nThe frescoes were painted on the walls and, thus, are not movable. The fresco cycles are stories moving from one wing of the Chapel to the next in an organized pattern. One of the most outstanding frescoes is the painting where Enrico presents the Arena Chapel to the Virgin Mary. The fresco of Enrico presenting the church is an allusion to the afterlife in which Giotto creates a fantasy story.\\n\\nIn this painting, the remarkable realism of Giotto뗩 work is showcased. Giotto뗩 great invention of painting in three dimensions is also depicted in the fresco showing the betrayal of Jesus. From this fresco, one can re-imagine the story of Judas betraying Christ with a kiss.\\n\\nReference\\n\\nTomei, A. (2017).

       " Document(page_content='Alex Hartley took 4-24 and Katherine Brunt 3-35 as the hosts were bowled out for 155, despite captain Stafanie Taylor\\'s 57. England looked tense at 56-2 in the chase, but Nat Sciver\\'s unbeaten 58 saw them home with 67 balls to spare. The victory means England are one win away from World Cup qualification. That could - and should - be achieved on the tour of Sri Lanka in November, when England will play three matches in the ICC Women\\'s Championship. Not only have Heather Knight\\'s side moved a step closer to booking a place in the home tournament in 2017, they have secured an impressive series victory in her first overseas tour in charge. Without wicketkeeper Sarah Taylor, who remains on a break from the game to deal with an anxiety problem, and injured pace bowler Anya Shrubsole, they have beaten the World Twenty20 champions in hot, humid conditions and on slow, spin-friendly surfaces. It is those conditions that have made run-scoring so difficult and the toss so important - in all four previous matches the side batting first had gone on to win. England again had to field first, albeit the later sunshine made batting easier in the afternoon, and their bowlers ensured the run-chase would be manageable. After Brunt and Georgia Elwiss removed Shaquana Quintyne and Hayley Matthews respectively, Hartley and fellow spinner Laura Marsh got to work on the middle order. With Marsh providing the squeeze from one end, Hartley\\'s accuracy induced poor strokes from Deandra Dottin, Merissa Aguilleira and Shemaine Campbelle. Taylor once again held the innings together with her third half-century in the five matches, but when she was stumped it gave Hartley a 13th wicket of the series, an England record in ODIs. With Brunt and off-spinner Knight running through the lower order, West Indies lost their last five wickets for 24 runs. England were in a strong position chasing 224 in the fourth ODI, only to give away five run-outs in a 42-run defeat. Here, they were restricted by West Indies\\' spinners early on, Lauren Winfield chipping Matthews to mid-wicket for 12 and Tammy Beaumont caught and bowled by Afy Fletcher for 34. With tension rising, the hosts threatened to find a way back into the match, especially with Knight dropped by Anisa Mohammed at short fine leg on only three. But the skipper combined with Sciver to reverse the pressure, scoring freely down the ground and, at one point, adding 26 runs in three overs. Though Knight was caught behind off impressive leg-spinner Fletcher, Sciver found an ally in the busy Danielle Wyatt on the way to her sixth ODI half-century. Wyatt was brilliantly caught at long-on by Britney Cooper, and Elwiss was bowled by Dottin, but there was to be no England wobble, with Amy Jones hitting the runs that sealed the series. England head coach Mark Robinson told BBC Sport: \"It\\'s absolutely outstanding. We\\'ve had it tough. It\\'s been ever so humid, red hot, and the wickets have been massively challenging. \"We\\'ve come to their back yard, they were on a high after winning the World T20 and we\\'ve shown a lot of character. I\\'m really proud of them. \"Hartley is a tough cookie. She doesn\\'t shy from hard work and she\\'s bowled outstandingly. She\\'s got a big future if she keeps working hard. \"We\\'re a young team and we\\'re learning as we go. We feel we\\'re going in the right direction and we feel we have shown everybody what we\\'re made of.\" Ex-England batter Lydia Greenway on BBC Test Match Special: \"England have shown a huge amount of character. Everyone in this series has played their part. \"There have been little turning points in individuals\\' careers, like Lauren Winfield playing consistently. \"A sign of a good team is showing consistency in all different kinds of situations and I\\'m sure they will want to carry that on when they go to Sri Lanka.\"'),\n",

When a woman is pregnant, you may be unable to tell but as times goes on, it is definitely going to show.\\n\\nPeople hide their true and real behaviors to get what they need or want.\\n\\nIn today\\'s world, struggles and difficulties are playing a very huge role in modern societies. Needs are the most crucial things in life. Some examples of needs are shelter, clothes and foods. We need all these to survive in life and we are going to lack something necessary, desirable or useful when we have no one to provide all those needs. So a person can act in a good way when you meet them for the first time because they just want to accomplish some goals. Last time, I was watching a Ghanaian movie with my family. In the movie, a man named Mr. Bright was very poor. He couldn\\'t cater for his wife and three daughters so, he decided to deceive every rich or wealthy woman he meets the first time. His first impressions to them was to act and brag as a wealthy man who travels to foreign countries to hoax the women and get some money to cater for his family.

So first impressions are possible to change because some factors affect humans all the time.\\n\\nSometimes relationship issues and depressions makes people behaviors change.\\n\\nMarriage is a union between two people in which no one can separate that.

Immediately I began to talk, she shouted as if I was a monster but later on I realized she was being bullied by some guys in our school. So the counselors helped her out and we became very close friends. I realized she was very respectful, kind and good. So how we see people for the first time doesn\\'t mean that is how they are. People change all the time.\\n\\nPeer pressures and bad friends make people characters change to a different level.\\n\\nYou will meet a person who was respectful for the first time but later on, you will find the same person talking back and arguing with their teachers in a very bad way. Bad friends are the worst thing in life. They can affect your future and perspectives. A girl who was very shy to talk in my class became the most disrespectful student in our class all because she joined some five bad girls in our school and after that, she decide to live the life she wants which was very bad. Our teachers know the road to success so they have to be respected and treated in a very nice way. No teacher wants his or her students to fail and every teacher wants to be awarded by the good efforts of their students. First impressions are possible to change all the time.\\n\\n\"Every coin has two faces\" so, we must deal with people in a very pleasant, patience and respectful way. A person may be good at the first time but changes later whiles a person may be bad at the first time but changes later because some factors like needs, depressions and poverty are affecting them.

Here is the best way to logically dismantle such arguments without making women seem like charity cases who just need society to do them this favour and pay them as much as men for the same work: It is true that periods and pregnancy reduce a person\\'s productivity and value as a worker, but so do migraine, horniness, being fat, insomnia, having too many kids etc. So a person who thinks that women\\'s periods and pregnancy should be taken into account when deciding their pay is also logically committed to supporting the idea that employers should examine each potential employee on the aforementioned attributes, predetermine their productivity and set their wage accordingly on an individual basis. However I very much doubt any sane person would take the extreme position that wages should be predetermined according to how fat a person is, how healthy heshe is, how many kids heshe has etc. Employers don\\'t have the right to examine each potential employee to see what physical features of their\\'s has the potential to inhibit productivity and pay all of them accordingly, therefore periods and pregnancy should not affect women\\'s wages.

After 9 months the room was still alike except there was some weird and wonderful emotion attached with it. This room was a silent friend with whom I could shed my tears freely whenever I was homesick.;Silently;but audaciously; this room taught me lessons of life, values and helped me to be myself. In this very room I learned to dance, read my first mills and boons, pulled up many all-nighters. While leaving the room, I could see other than just pale features of my cubicle. The small window was large enough to let rays of sun to give warmth;24 cement squares completed the floor of the room, the walls stood still, but they spoke the language of strength. Most of all it was this very incident which bonded me with this room; It would have been any other Saturday noon if I hadn\\'t remodeled my cubicle. I was alone and bored, and I needed some work: As I looked from my the-inner-designer-eyes I found the room to be a bit crowded. And then I started my work; with my girly power I pushed all the lockers one by one as to place them on a row and the bunk bed were just adjacent to each other; the room now looked spacious as previously the scattered lockers occupied too much space. I was happy with my result, and I was proud of it; anxiously waiting for my friends to return and see their expressions. I had some work with my senior about my biology practicals;so I had to leave the room, and it was not until 5pm I returned to may room. As I entered the room; The room was just the same; all my hours of remodeling was gone; like \"abracadabra\" and who shh!!! My three friends were just busy with their own jobs, they appeared to be. I was disheartened as they not only spoke with me but didn\\'t care to bring the topic, but later after supper I spoke my heart out. It was me against my dearest friends; me against the wrong, but I was wrong till that time, even if I did the right thing, I did it against the wish of my friends. The cubicle was not entirely of mine, my friends were also the part of it. My friends were not angry with me but with my action;it had hurt them.

       " Document(page_content=\"This was pretty damn close to the most disgusting meal I've ever been served. I made the mistake of coming here for brunch on a saturday morning with the wifey while being wallet-raped by Danny's Car Wash for an oil change (see review). It was open and across the street and I'd heard about it, so I figured what the hell. Big mistake, this meal didn't help my mood. The build your own omelette and bloody mary seemed great on paper. I didn't even care that I had a waitress-in-training that had absolutely no clue what was going on. After all, I had time to kill. I guess taking a piece of paper from a diner to the cook and bartender is difficult labor requiring highly skilled and specialized employees. But wait! The bartender doesn't know how to make a mimosa? A retarded monkey could make a mimosa. In between flinging feces on the walls and picking fleas out of its hair. That, at least, would have been entertaining. So I'm going over my omelette choices. No green bell peppers? For real? A mexican joint with no green bell peppers? I actually wrote it in, hoping that this was an egregious oversight by the menu-making committee and they did actually have them. I finished selecting my omelette fixins, including chorizo. I received a plate with a pound of dog food and jalapeno peppers wrapped in an egg. I'm positive not one morsel of this mystery meat was USDA approved for human consumption, let alone a massive pile of it. And I'm positive jalapenos are not bell peppers. You know what? In retrospect, this was the most disgusting meal I've ever been served. Don't come here for food.\"),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"Wicked spoon is by far by favorite Vegas buffet, but after reading reviews about how it's fallen off we decided to try Cesar's. It's the only decent buffet I haven't been to. Standing in line eagerly, even after we heard it'd be a 45 minute wait. I was excited, and hungry! Buffets are my absolute favorite, I get bored easily, so I usually opt for sushi or tapas so I can try a few things at once. Finally when we were seated the excitement continued, oooh Asian station, ahh seafood! Ramen and pho?? I decided to head for the Asian station first, which had some sushi and dim sum. The sushi immediately made my stomach turn and all of a sudden my hunger had vanished. The salmon was a burnt orange color... On the verge of turning brown and the tuna just looked rotten. I was quite shocked as I saw alot of people still opting for the sushi..but I looked again and realized everyone I saw was non asian. Hmph, I decided to steer clear - I've had food poisoning once and it's definitely no fun. Had some dim sum which was really authentic - (up to par with elite) The fresh shrimp was good, The king crab legs were decent, but I had a few frozen pieces which were a huge turn off. I understand that happens at Asian buffets, but c'mon! Seriously Cesar's?! The prime rib line was ridiculous, stood in line for another 20 minutes. But I figured hey, this must be their best dish - but no: (my slice was far too overcooked, and I don't know who said it's better than Lawrys, but they're smoking crack. The ramen and pho were surprisingly not bad. Not the best I've ever had but actually decent. Btw they don't have hoison for the pho, only sirracha. The sliders looked ridiculously good oozing with cheese, but yet again overcooked. If you like your patty well done - this dish is for you. All in all my favorites were the juice section dessert. The juice selection had fresh cucumber, tomato, grapefruit and a few others. the cucumber tasted so fresh, lovely after a night of drinking vegas. The dessert section had an amazing lava cake. Not overly sweet, just perfect. I was quite sad they had no macarons though: (they are only made for dinner. They had a variety of gelato flavors I've never heard of, so that was cool. Try thai tea:) Also - maybe this buffet was better once upon a time, because half of the dishes in the pictures were nonexsistent when I went. I probably won't be returning, for 110 after tax and tip for a party of two - the juice and dessert weren't THAT good. I'd rather go to wicked spoon or the buffet at m resort.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Couple things to remember: it isn\\'t just what people think of them it is the number of people thinking it,on your home field you have the roar of the crowd not the four diehard fans that traveled to a different town to see you.You slept in your own bed and had breakfast with your loved ones at home games compared to a bus ride on rough roads or a plane trip the day before and if your lucky a crappy hotel with a loud bar under your room or and air-conditioner or heater that squeaks. A lot of things that can throw you off your game the next day. You are a lot more at ease at home,\" \"Yes to all of those. I think it\\'s gotten better, but I had read some stories in the past of refs being a little more biased towards home teams, so that helps too. It\\'s not a big factor in basketball (besides the refs) but there are some advantages to being used to where you are playing. There were urban legends of the celtics knowing where the dead spots on the floor were in the old Boston Garden, and even tho every hoop is 10 feet high, what you see when you are shooting is different everywhere, and familiarity can\\'t hurt (see lower shooting in the Final Four where college kids have to play in football arenas. Noise during free throws for the road team is also a thing Noise is a much bigger deal in football as cheering when the QB is trying to call a play and get the ball snapped can be a big deal. Also being familiar with the winds that usually happen in a particular stadium and being used to wild temperature changes has an impact that would be hard to exactly measure. Hockey and Baseball have actual home field advantage baked into the rules besides all that other stuff that would be harder to quantify and may be urban legend. In baseball the home team gets to bat last, so they know exactly how many runs they need to score to win in close games at the end. that also impacts how the road team can play in that situation, since the best way to get 1 run and the best way to get 2 runs in an inning may not be the same thing, the road team doesn\\'t know how many runs they need when they bat in extra innings, but the home team can play to only score 1 in the bottom of the 9th in a tie game. Also in baseball familiarity with the dimensions of the field is important, and usually a team will be designed to play in their home stadium (fly ball pitchers in big fields where it\\'s hard to hit hrs, lefty sluggers in Yankee stadium, etc) In hockey, the home team gets to change last (if they are allowed to change). That means they get to have the matchups that they want on the ice for most of the faceoffs (and for most of the game.) they also get the advantage on who puts their stick down first on the faceoff (only at center ice now in the nhl). Also, familiarity with how the puck bounces off the boards can help.,is it so much higher? quick google says 55-60. good, but not exactly overwhelming. reasons might be fan noise, though that makes the most sense in football where they might be able to affect communication. THough football is on the lower end of the advantage.... could pep the players up, or make the opponent undisciplined. Or maybe just a familiarity with the venue, no travel, no time change, sleep in their own bed, ect ect. probably all of the above and more.\\', \"something I haven\\'t seen mention is the possibility of travel fatigue affecting a home-team less (less travel time, etc).,Would you rather take a shit in your own house or a public restroom?'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Nursing Leadership and Management Issues Essay\\n\\nIt is difficult to overestimate the role of communication skills for nurses because they meet a great variety of people every day. In addition, everyone has to develop leadership skills if they want to make a real difference. I think the course advanced my knowledge of the leadership concept, and the implementation of theory helped me improve patient care delivery.\\n\\nAs a nurse, I work in a team, and therefore it is hard to underestimate the role of effective communication. I analyzed the reasons why work in a group is sometimes so stressful to me and understood my direction for growth. One of the reasons for failure in communication lies in the inability to encourage an exchange of information (Weiss et al., 2019). The probable decision is to learn to ask the right questions and concise questions. Additionally, researchers point out the value of prioritizing (Weiss et al., 2019).\\n\\nRevising my views on setting priorities, I realized I used to do it unconsciously. However, now I carefully evaluate what I should do, estimate the time, and explore delegation possibilities. These changes not only allowed me to increase my effectiveness but to concentrate more on patients problems.\\n\\nWhile working with patients, it is crucial to establish contact and motivate them to strive for healing. The possible direction for growth that I see is the development of emotional intelligence. An emotionally intelligent leader is a good listener, i.e., emotional intelligence allows leaders to sense the unspoken, feel the perspectives, and recognize the motivation of others (Weiss et al., 2019). Sometimes I meet patients who are eager to impress me with the nature of their illness. Others are closed and silent, so I need more observations to realize their needs. Hence, I practice my skills as an active listener to consider their individual character traits, dispel fears and gain the patients trust to ensure that my patients will confidently go to any diagnostic procedure.\\n\\nDue to the course, my leadership attitude changed greatly since I started to apply new knowledge to my practice. I recognized the perspectives for my self-improvement, such as emotional intelligence and prioritizing, and now I have some positive results. Moreover, I believe that further exploration of the topic could make me a more confident and stress-resistant person.\\n\\nReference\\n\\nWeiss, S. A., Tappen, R. M., & Grimley, K. (2019).

These factors include: my community, family, and school. These aspects have a an important part of my life. My community has influenced me greatly to be a hard-working person. It has opened my eyes and taught me that not everything in life is handed to you effortlessly. I have learned that \\\\ those who persevere will manage to meet their goal in life. There is an abundance of students in my community that are very competitive, and I feel it is my job to be prominent. My community has encouraged me to work hard and persevere my dreams until I attain them. Apart from my community another factor that contributes a great deal to my dreams and aspirations is my family. My father never had any of the opportunities I have obtained today and still managed to work his way up. As a child he faced many family and economic troubles; with these struggles he was still capable of turning his life around and was able to provide our family with what he never had as a child. He was a veterinarian in Mexico after finishing college but when he came to the Unites States all his work was like if he did nothing. He has been a truck driver for a good 25 years, and manages to own property and support our family. I plan to finish what he started in Mexico and become a veterinarian as well. My passion for animals is unexplainable, being a veterinarian has always been my dream as a child. I intend to do the best I can to reach these dreams and aspirations, and make my father proud. As mentioned previously, school has also molded me into the person I am today. I see school as competition; I believe that those who work hard throughout high school will succeed in the future. This is one of the reasons why I have challenged myself by taking advanced courses at my school. I feel the need to push myself in order to be fully prepared for the future. Apart from advanced courses I have also joined various types of clubs and sports. Clubs have also made me realize the satisfaction gained from helping someone in need, and helping the community. Not only that, but it has helped me be more expressive, and be more social among my peers. School in general has helped me to be more competitive and a demanding person towards my aspirations. These aspects have contributed greatly to the dreams and goals I have set in my mind. I plan to pursue these goals by working hard until I obtain them. Accepting any opportunity and any challenges that cross my path with benefit me by making me a stronger person mentally. Anybody is capable of succeeding, it is just the matter of who wants it more.

Would like some help regarding grammatical errors, as well as an opinion whether this is decent or if I should add more. Considering that my essay is only 520 words and the max is 3800 characters, I am not sure if it is enough. Thank you so much!! Your help will be highly appreciated. I have always wanted to attend Rutgers University ever since I was young because of its reputation. As I matured, I realized there are more important factors in determining the college I would like to attend, and its reputation isn't necessarily the most important. As I discovered that not every college has all majors, I hoped that Rutgers would. Not only does Rutgers offer a major in Biology-Premed and mechanical engineering, but I'm also allowed to double major. It also has a Greek system, which I have always wanted to partake in. I am certain that a Rutgers education will help me accomplish all my career goals as well as help me mature into a professional in all the fields that I have planned to major on. I am the first generation in my immigrant family to ever attend college. My mother brought me along with her from Portugal when I was seven years old in hope to live a better life. I want to have the opportunity to honor both my family and Rutgers with my success. Being that my mother is a very hardworking woman, she is never around to acknowledge my efforts, but when I graduate Rutgers University I am sure she will be full of pride of how much I will have accomplished. A Rutgers education will allow me to attain my personal and professional goals through a high quality education recognized worldwide. A higher education is very valuable to me because I believe it will build a bridge to the person that I dream of becoming. Also, knowing the history of this university, Rutgers will give me nationally-respected credentials which will open many doors for me in an economy where it is so difficult to find a respectable job. I intend to get the most out of a Rutgers education, gaining knowledge and exploiting it as much as I can into which will contribute towards my future career in Psychiatry and Mechanical Engineering. I chose Rutgers as my first choice because it has all the possible majors into which I would like to pursue a career in. It is also one of the top colleges in New Jersey due to its leadership, nationally recognized faculty, in addition to its diverse state, which I feel connected to because I am an immigrant as several other students who came here to accomplish their dreams through hard work and ambition. Rutgers also pays attention to many practices which I would love to explore and offers the positions of internships in high-end organizations, which absolutely contributes to the development of graduates' proficiency in their professional career in the future. The opportunity that a diverse faculty and student body will give me, as well as the reputation Rutgers has in education is far too good of an opportunity to pass up. I have a few friends at Rutgers who all speak highly of their school and how staff are very helpful, supportive, and guiding. I look forward to being a part of such a highly recognized university with everything I need to become the person I yearn to be.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Dear Rick Scott, Every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday of November, the Electoral College casts their votes to elect the new President of the United States of America. These voters are chosen by the citizens of their state Florida, Texas, etc. to vote in their favor of their preferred party. For example, a Democratic voter in California will vote for Democratic Electoral College candidates to vote for their preferred President. Though many people are opposed to this method of voting, calling it an anachronism & taking away the vote from the citizens of the United States, American citizen\\'s votes still count, the Electoral College can avoid problems popular voting could result in, and the Electoral College listens to those with the initiative and right to make a smart vote. For these reasons I would like to keep the Electoral College.\\n\\nThe Founding Fathers established the Electoral College as a compromise between election of the President by a vote of Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens, meaning one vote almost relies on the other. A common misconception made by citizens is that when they vote they vote for a President, when in fact they are voting for people to vote in their favor for the President. So the more Republican Electoral College voters your state has, most likely the end vote will be the electoral votes go to the Republican candidate. Many people say that the electoral college \"takes away the votes of the citizens, and that their vote doesn\\'t matter\" when in reality, they matter in every way possible. If the citizens do not vote, who will vote for the electoral college members? And without the citizens to decide who the members of the Electoral College will be, who will be in the Electoral College all together?\\n\\nNot only do the Citizen\\'s votes count, but the Electoral College can help solve the problems that a popular voting system could have. The Electoral College votes with the majority of the state, meaning that the party with the highest request for its Presidency, the Electoral College will cast its votes towards. Meaning a highly Democratic state can count on their state\\'s vote to most likely be for the Democratic candidate. The Electoral College also avoids runoff elections. This means that the election will always show a clear winner for the state\\'s vote. There is a lot of potential pressure for a runoff election when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cats that pressure could greatly affect the Presidential election process, which the Electoral College reduces, ultimately showing a clear winner.\\n\\nAnd finally, the Electoral College listens to smart and eligible voters. Very rarely does a State\\'s Electoral College vote against the wishes of their citizens. In fact that would be the exact opposite of their job. It\\'s also an inetible fact that not every voter is an ideal voter. Many citizens do not keep themselves up to date on the issues candidates plan to solve, occupation backgrounds, or even their personality. Many voters in fact vote on astetics, which is ultimately the most dangerous voter there is an uner educated one.\\n\\nSo Mr. Scott, I hope you take into account that an in terms of an electoral college, an American citizen\\'s vote does count, they avoid the problems popular votes could create, and they do listen to their state\\'s smart, eligable voters. If the Founding Fathers created this tool for the balance in our voting system, then balance there shall be.'),\n",

Unfortunately, the company is at risk of losing some of them as customers. The company뗩 management team needs a strategy to save the company from detaching from its customers. The service manager, therefore, came up with a plan to curb the problem. The procedure entails special services targeted at women, including services such as one-on-one instruction of doing it yourself skills and free in-home consultations. The services will help maintain loyal women customers for the good of the company. The company will also offer free in-home consultations to enable the customer to visualize what is possible and design and determine a personalized solution for their home. The in-home consultation assists in developing a solution.\\n\\nThe service manager presented the plan to the management team, but one of the executives opposed the program, most of the groups supported him. The executive gives three points why the management should not carry out the plan. If the program is implemented, customers will build their hopes for more unique services and demand free flooring and carpeting. The service manager disagrees with the executive, saying that there is a backup plan if this happens. The backup plan consists of three steps that deal with the demanding customers (Cavalieri 2023). The first step is to understand the customer뗩 problem and remain calm since the customer may not understand the impact their request may have on the company (Cavalieri 2099). Understanding the customer뗩 problem will increase the company뗩 sales. The second step is explaining the situation to the customer in a way that they will appreciate. It gives a clear understanding of the situation and the customer feels appreciated. Step three is where the problem is resolved by finding a win-win situation, make a 랊ne-time-only offer or refuse politely. Giving a customer an offer they cannot refuse will make them think the problem is solved. The three steps will greatly assist the company with the demanding customers. The manager should be customer-centric in order to satisfy the customer뗩 expectations entirely (Cavalieri 2112). Customer satisfaction is the most important aspect in every organization.\\n\\nThe executive also argues that the more members of the management team oppose the idea, the more it makes it a bad idea. However, members can try to reconsider their decision and support the idea. It is advisable to give the new strategy a chance and see its impacts first hand. When the results of the program come out negative that is when the management should declare the plan misleading and should be expelled. Furthermore, the administration should apply the program since it is the only option (Fountaine 67). One cannot completely know if a plan works until members give it a chance.\\n\\nThe executive also points out that the competitors applied the customer service plan specifically for women, but the plan failed. He explains that if the project failed for the competitor, then chances are it may also fail in this case (Fountaine 73). One of the biggest roadblocks to success is the fear of failure. Researchers found that success in the face of failure comes out due to focusing on the results rather than trying not to fail. Successful people in history see failure as a stepping stone to the next stage. Management should not refuse to apply the program because of its negative results in another company. The company should carry out the procedure for a successful outcome (Fountaine 63). The Company should use the best methods to try and implement the idea.\\n\\nWork Cited\\n\\nCavalieri, Sergio, et al. Service transformation in industrial companies.

       " Document(page_content='Justices Rule Human Genes cannot be Patented Essay\\n\\nThe article, titled Justices Rule Human Genes cannot be Patented, reports a ruling by the United States Supreme Court on a case between Myriad Genetics and other stakeholders who were fighting against Myriad뗩 claim for exclusive rights to patent human genes. The main point of the article, it seems, is that human genetic material cannot be patented because it is a product of nature rather than nurture.\\n\\nThe article, by quoting the justices of the Supreme Court, stresses that although scientists and biotechnologists may have the capacity to isolate the gene from the genetic material and use this break-through technology to prevent various diseases such as breast and ovarian cancer, they cannot claim patents for making the gene itself as this process occurs naturally.\\n\\nIn view of this point, the Supreme Court denied Myriad Genetics the exclusive rights to patent and own human genes, and stressed the fact that genes and the information they encode are not patent-eligible simply because a company has succeeded in isolating the genes from the surrounding genetic material.\\n\\nThe article is from a credible source as it has been published in a respected newspaper. Editors of newspapers such as USA Today always ensure the authenticity of content before publishing. Additionally, the author of the article often makes mention of his sources of information, further reinforcing the article뗩 credibility.\\n\\nAll the facts included in the article directly support the ruling that human genetic material cannot be patented because it is a product of nature rather than nurture.\\n\\nFor instance, it has been demonstrated how the health and wellbeing of breast and ovarian cancer patients will be jeopardized by monopolizing the human genes through giving one company exclusive patent rights. Arguably, the cost of seeking for treatment for such forms of cancer will definitely go up in spite of the fact that scientists have already identified the gene that normally dysfunction to trigger cancerous tumors.\\n\\nAnother supporting fact that has been explained in the article is that patenting of human genes may also limit research activities and advances in human genetics. Additionally, it has been acknowledged that genes and the information they encode are naturally occurring and hence no single individual or organization can claim a patent for their existence or perceived discovery. In short, genes and the information they encode cannot be termed as products of innovation.\\n\\nIn my view, there was no notable bias from the author of this article which is worth mentioning. Indeed, the researcher does well to balance the positive and the negative sides of the Supreme Court ruling. The positive elements have already been discussed in this paper.\\n\\nHowever, on the negative elements, the author notes the historic ruling may create precedence whereby other biotechnology companies will be objecting to making huge investments in research due to incapacity to own the patents to protect their scientific discoveries. This is a valid concern that warrants closer scrutiny.\\n\\nOverall, the major learning outcome is that human genes are naturally occurring and hence cannot be patented by any individual or organization. The second learning outcome is that genetic research is critical in dealing with the rampant cases of breast and ovarian cancer witnessed in the society today. Lastly, the idea of patenting scientific discoveries and the limits that one can go has been well explicated in the article.\\n'),\n",

This is important because if you only ask one person they can use their bias opinion to make a person or situation seem better or worse than it actually was. Another example is in football when there is a call being made all the refs huddle up to talk about their opinions on what happened during the play. This highlights the fact that when there are multiple opinions the out come is usually better and more logical.\\n\\nSecondly, another good thing about seeking others opinions it can give you more options to choose from. For instance, this happens a lot in the sports world on final plays of the game. What happens is there is not much time left on the clock so they all try to figure out the best play possible to win and try to execute it. This is only useful when there is multiple opinions and plays coming in because with out different options than the one option used might not have been the best one or the most successful. To illustrate, another time having multiple opinions\\xa0is helpful is when you have a girlfriend. I had the similar thing happen to me when I was dating someone because I didn\\'t have any ideas for a date, so when I asked my friends I had much better and more ideas. All the ideas were helpful and useful and made my date worth while.\\n\\nLastly, seeking advice from multiple people is better because it keeps you closer to the people around you. An example of this is when I asked my friends for their opinion on the sport of basketball it not only made me contact them and talk to them but now they know that I am working on a report for school. This helps all of us out because know they know i\\'m working on my report which means I can\\'t hang out right now and I reminded them about it and made them do it. In addition, this happens a lot when my mom asks one of our neighbors for their opinion on a certain product, but it ends up turning into them catching up and talking for the first time in a while. This helps my mom and our neighbors to stay in touch and get better opinions on products or services.\\n\\n\"Hey guys, what do you think I should do for me and Generic_Name\\'s anniversary?\" asks Generic_Name. They all think for a quick second then spit out ideas at Generic_Name like a waterfall. \"Necklace, gift, chocolate, and flowers.\" quickly states the group. While Generic_Name is still processing the information, he says, \"I think i\\'ll just go with the necklace and flowers, but thanks for the ideas.\" All in all, seeking out multiple opinions for advice is better than only having one opinion.'),\n",

Differences between Regenerative and Net-Change MRP Systems\\n 3. Benefits and Limitations of MRP as a Push-System\\n 4. Reference\\n\\nMaterial Requirement Planning System뗩 Inputs and Outputs\\n\\nMaterial requirements planning is the system for turning master schedule requirements for end items into time-phased requirements for subassemblies, components, and raw materials. Inputs and outputs are affecting the MRP and its efficiency. The inputs required to build a system are a master schedule formed by orders and forecasts, design changes plan process with a bill of materials, and inventory records containing receipts and withdrawals (Stevenson, 2014). When MRP is set up and used, several outcomes appear, and they can be divided into primary and secondary reports and an inventory transaction. Primary outputs are changes, order releases, and planned-order schedules, and the secondary ones are the exception, planning, and performance-control reports (Stevenson, 2014). The proper translation of master requirements can help successfully manage the order and appliance of assemblies and raw materials.\\n\\nDifferences between Regenerative and Net-Change MRP Systems\\n\\nMPR can be updated via the two most useful systems: regenerative and net-change approaches. The main difference between these practices is that the regenerative system edits MRP뗩 data periodically, while the net-change one does it continuously (Stevenson, 2014). The regenerative method is based on picking an interval and complying with the changes in all aspects to discover what MPR뗩 updates to make (Stevenson, 2014). The net-change approach modifies a system after every requirement of change on a continuous basis (Stevenson, 2014). The regenerative system is the most suitable for managing stable MRPs, while the net-change method can deal with the inconsistent ones.\\n\\nBenefits and Limitations of MRP as a Push-System\\n\\nMRP is a push system that helps determine the costs, quantities, and availability requirements in a time-based manner so that the results can be forecasted and then achieved. This operation method뗩 benefits are low demand for in-process updates, the ability to manage material and capacity requirements, the allocation of production time, and the potential to determine the inventory usage (Stevenson, 2014). MRP implementation뗩 main limitation is the necessity to have a computer with the software capable of handling calculations and maintaining records. Moreover, the system can only be applied if accurate and approved master schedules, bills, and inventory records are properly collected (Stevenson, 2014). Any inexact piece of data can lead the companies to significant order, production, and delivery issues.\\n\\nReference\\n\\nStevenson, W. (2014). Operations Management. (12th ed.).

Also, Notre Dame is a Catholic school, so I'm worried about doing anything too violent or immoral. Please tell me which is better and edit that one! ESSAY #1: I felt the heat before anything else. It burned the back of my neck, grazed my shoulders, and scorched the soles of my feet. The dryness of my mouth struck next. It was impossible to swallow, and my throat was scraped with each inhale. I felt a rocking sensation. My eyes were crusted shut, but I managed to open them as I vomited. My stomach dropped the second I adjusted to the light. I ached for my previous unconsciousness. The sky was cloudless. The sun was directly overhead, blistering my skin and chapping my lips. The view was the same regardless of the direction I turned my head. I was surrounded by endless water, salty waves calmly lapping at the sides of the small wooden structure-a door, or maybe a legless table-that was solely responsible for keeping me afloat. Nothing interrupted the horizon. My eyes desperately scanned for the reinvigorating sight of land or a boat, but I was utterly alone. My heart began beating fast in my throat, my breathing shallow and too frequent. A scream tried to escape my mouth, but caught in the hoarse dryness. Where was I? How did I get here? What was I going to do? ESSAY #2: The boat slowed to a stop, and I smiled as my windblown hair fell about my face. Each ocean wave sprayed salty mist against my skin. The sun threw shades of purple, orange, and pink as it rose on the horizon. I giggled in excitement, pulling my wetsuit over my shoulders. I awkwardly waddled in my fins to meet my father at the back of the boat. He helped as I routinely strapped on all the gear-the weight belt, the BCD vest attached to the air tank, and the air regulator-and I eagerly waited as he did the same. Finally, holding tight to my mask, I jumped. I stayed afloat on the warm ocean waves for only a moment. Soon I was smiling, regulator in mouth, breathing the clean oxygen, sinking further and further into the deep blue. Fish shimmered as they swam by. My father was underwater, too, and guided my attention to the large opening of a cave in the rocks below. Colorful coral decorated the area, and mesmerizing creatures were abundant, but the cave held my interest. We'd never explored this abyss. I swam into the mystery.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Recent years have witnessed a tremendous increase in the number of people who want to spend their life alone. Since numerous of them, especially young aged, have a tendency to avoid starting a family, the negative effect of this case should be intensively considered. Many people stand for a belief that the trend of living individually is a consequence of several objective reasons which related to booming economy or immoral perception. Apparently, working in such strained working environments where tasks and deadlines are crucial than anything, accidentally become a barrier that prevent people from enjoying social activities. To be more specific, they are now busier than before and thus difficult to find a partner. Moreover, in many Eastern cultures where the perception of male-dominated is still exist, the proportion between male and female become seriously unbalanced, meaning that a man obviously have little chance to find his fianc칠e. Take Vietnam as an example, sex ratio is 126 men compares to 100 of their counterparts, which interprets that one out of five men in marriageable age will have no opportunities to marry. On the other hand, I am of the opinion that the trend undoubtedly causes negative effect to modern society. Firstly, because of many people living in a single life, the level of social relationship will gradually decrease. Indeed, the period of time spending for social activities is usually replaced by the time in workplace, therefore, people will find extremely hard to interact even with their neighbors. Secondly, it is undeniable that if numerous of people decide to live by themselves, the population will inevitably be reduced. As a result, the national economy will be affected noticeably due to the shortage of people in labor age. In conclusion, while there are certainly arguments to be made for this issue, I strongly believe that the downside effect of the trend is outweighed its benefits.

Everything about her was perfection, yet the very thought of her was enough to cause unfathomable pain-had he had the ability to feel it. He went to her at night, as she lay in her bed, her hair tousled slightly, fanned across her pillow like an aqua wave, cascading in shining tendrils down her shoulders. Silently, he exhaled, his breath forming a halo in front of his face, catching the moonlight as he approached her bedside. She groaned and twisted, turning to her other side, her full, pink lips parted slightly as she calmed. Her creamy, pale skin beckoned to him, calling him without words. To feel her, to taste her-he would have done anything. He would have suffered the pain of death a thousand times just for the gift of the scent of her hair. Watching, he noticed her chest, rising and falling gently in a hypnotizing rhythm. Oh, what he would do to feel her breath. Slowly, careful not to wake her, he knelt on the bed. Though his very existence was futile, thread-bare and fleeting, he knew she would feel him. In the darkness, the deafening stillness, all he knew was her. Her eyes, their breath-taking sapphire light hidden, fluttered behind closed lids. She felt him, he knew she did. This hope was all that he needed. He clung to it like he longed to cling to her lithe, perfect body. Reaching out with trembling fingers, he stroked her skin as the emotions stroked his mind. His fingers melted, scorched by the searing heat of her tender flesh, and he sighed. He would never know the feel of her skin. Every night he tried, and thus far he failed. Again, the small sound like the mewl of a newborn kitten, and her eyes popped open. The pain, the anguish and fear he saw there hit his heart like a thousand stabs. He hated that she felt this way. He hated that she would never know that he would give anything to take away all of her pain. She turned, and he could see the grip of panic taking hold of her. Her eyes widened, and she turned beneath him, and finally, for a split second, her blue eyes locked with his. He felt his inside jump (Happiness?) and a smile folded his delicate features. He leaned down to her, brushing his lips across hers gently, careful not to frighten her. \"I love you...\" She gasped, and he straightened. He had gone too far, and he knew it. He never wanted this. Never wanted it to come to this. For a long time he had been content just watching. Now, he needed her. As he stood from the bed, she sprung up, sitting bolt upright, her eyes darting around the room. \"Hello? Is someone there?\" His head hung, he turned to leave the room. As he reached the door, he turned one last time to gaze as her beauty. What he saw there made his lips curl in a smile.

       " Document(page_content='Music and Cultural Appropriation Essay\\n\\nMusic is not only an industry but an essential element of culture. In some cases, musicians adopt elements from other cultures, which results in cultural appropriation (Crayton 2018). Chaskinakuy is a band of Peruvian natives who want to share the music of people living in mountainous areas of South America. Their music does not feature cultural appropriation because they were born in the same area whose music they are sharing. Although their style is a mix of several genres, no cultural appropriation can be found because they were born and raised in that culture.\\n\\nDaryl Hall would agree with my view because he believes that any culture is actually a blend of other cultures that had existed previously in history. Therefore, he strongly opposes the notion of cultural appropriation, especially in the United States, which is a country of many nations and cultures. When a musician writes a song, they do not think of whether or not to adopt elements from other cultures. Instead, their song-writing is influenced by the culture they grew up in. In other words, they are members of that culture too, and should not be accused of stealing others culture and identity.\\n\\nI do not think that Daryl Hall and John Oates are appropriating African American soul/R&B. Claiming so would mean that Eminem is stealing African American rap, when in reality, Marshall grew up in this rap culture. Hall뗩 music represents his life experiences and the culture he is part of. Cultural appropriation is not always wrong  sometimes musicians may want to pay tribute to a specific culture and use some of their elements. Cultural appropriation is not acceptable when it is meant to undermine that culture.\\n\\nReference\\n\\nCrayton, L. A. (2018). Everything You Need to Know About Cultural Appropriation .

I asked my parents to reconsider, but of course they were pensive about our future. They knew life a lot better than a 12-year-old diva. I hopped on the plane for the first time in my life. I felt uncomfortable, anxious, and nervous. When I arrived, I suffered from culture shock. I was soon forced out of my childhood because my parents didn't speak English and I barely spoke English. My teachers welcomed me at school and helped me to enhance my English. I worked really hard on my English at home. Soon I was told that I didn't need to take any ESL classes because I placed really high on my English test. I was really overjoyed. Unfortunately, I encountered my worst fear of losing my loved ones. I lost 8 of my loved ones in 2015. All of these deaths were unforeseen and left me emotionally damaged. I felt adrift, numb, and sad. I sensed my stomach drop and anticipated nothing was wrong, but later perceived that this was the new normal. Furthermore, I had difficulty handling so many deaths. Furthermore, I started dealing with anxiety and depression. This really affected my school as my grades dropped. My teachers and my peers helped me perceive that I have to be stronger. They assisted me as I got back on track. I realized that I really want to help others just as much my peers helped me. This phase of my life has taught me so much. I learned that life is very short, I used to believe that people die when they get old and have accomplished their dreams. I now perceived that there is no set date of death, I can die anytime and anywhere. My loved ones were set to make their dreams come true such as leaving for college, buying a house, and starting a family, but sadly their dreams didn't come true. I have learned to accept death, and now I am not arrogant like I used to be. Now, I make sure there that I: am kind to everyone, express my curiosity, spend time with my loved ones, laugh, and most importantly make my dreams come true. A new student from India started school, and she didn't speak any English. I was asked if I wanted to help, and I took that opportunity with a smile because I was in her spot a few months ago. I showed the girl around school, introduced her to teachers, and helped her in translating. Furthermore, I helped her, and soon she passed her English test. Furthermore, I was so happy for her accomplishment. Furthermore, I realized that I loved helping others, so I started volunteering at our local library where English classes are held for adults. Furthermore, I translated for the Punjabi and Hindi students. Furthermore, I was offered the position of an assistant teacher. Furthermore, I got to help many individuals grow, and do great things in life. Furthermore, I learned to find happiness by making other people happier rather than spending money on materialistic items. My family went through the hardship of not knowing English. Thanks to my amazing community for helping and encouraging me with everything. Without their help, I wouldn't be who I am today. Though I still deal with anxiety attacks, I won against my depression. I am a lot stronger now than I was before. My grades have improved, and I plan on earning all A's at university. I want admissions officers to know this tidbit about me because this experience has really changed my positively. I have come to realize that helping others genuinely makes me happy.

       " Document(page_content='God뗩 Existence: Ren칠 Descartes Meditations on First Philosophy Essay\\n\\nRen칠 Descartes is a famous philosopher of the Enlightenment, whose work became a breakthrough of rational thinking for his time. Confident that the existence of God and the soul could not be proved by the usual theological arguments from holy scripture, he began to look for natural causes (Descartes 1641, 1). In Meditations on First Philosophy, through six reflections, Descartes seeks to destroy the existing foundations of human knowledge and find a reliable justification for them. He comes to the thesis that the doubt in the reality of perception testifies to the consciousness and existence of a person and that the features of human nature evidence God뗩 existence.\\n\\nBeginning his work with questioning everything that can be doubted even a little, Descartes develops his arguments to prove God뗩 presence. The philosopher is confident that all the information that people receive with the senses help is doubtful. This argument demonstrates the weakness of the foundations of human knowledge. However, even in order to make a mistaken judgment and be deceived by an evil demon, there must be a mind, which evidences the existence of a person. At the same time, what people accept by the senses cannot be part of the mind, and therefore exist outside of it, which proves the existence of the universe. Returning to doubts as part of human nature, Descartes sees them as an argument for human imperfection. Nevertheless, the very idea of perfection indicates its existence, that is, the concept of God  a thought created by God. Thus, for his time, the philosopher found a balance between science and religion.\\n\\nA strong objection to Descartes arguments may be the assumption that the clarity of the mind can also be doubted in addition to the outside world. If people cannot be sure of the intelligibility of judgment, they also cannot be confident in the validity of the idea of God. People suffering from mental disorders can be certain in the clarity of their consciousness. Moreover, Descartes statement that humans could not independently develop the concept of God can also be questioned since the possibilities of mind are still being studied.\\n\\nReference\\n\\nDescartes, R. 1641.

If something drastic has happened such as physical damage, then the cell will most likely go through necrosis and explode its tiny cell bits everywhere, which is fun to imagine but really it just creates a hole in the cell membrane for the organelles to be released and denatured. For necrosis to happen, receptors on the cell are activated and the hole is made. The scientific word for the holes (or what is about to be the hole) is bleb, which is a fun word too.

Gary Ewing was already arrested several times for burglaries and robbery. The last time he stole three golf clubs that worth $1197. The victim, a Los Angeles-area golf course, was represented by California. The man was on parole at that time, so he had to be sentenced at least for 25 years according to three strikes law.\\n\\nHe was convinced of felony grand theft but asked to reduce the conviction to a misdemeanor while being behind bars. However, this request was declined. In the framework of his appeal, the offender stated that his punishment was too severe compared to the crime. In this way, Ewing wanted to prove that the decision made by the court violated the Eighth Amendment and had to be altered because it was cruel. Still, the three strikes law supported the state, and the appeal was rejected. When the California Supreme Court was approached, it refused to consider the case at all.\\n\\nIn this particular case, the court made a decision on the basis of the three strikes law. They are typically used in those cases when offenders are sentences over and over. Governmental bodies claim that such law has a legitimate goal that approves their existence. It is believed that being punished for a period of time between 25 years and the whole life when committing a new crime, individuals are deprived of a capacity to repeat their offenders.\\n\\nSuch belief is universal, which means that there is no separation between the crimes regardless of their severity. Basically, the government wanted to ensure the safety of the representatives of the general public with this law. In this way, there was a legitimate support of such an approach and proof that it did not violate the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In this way, this law ignored the possibility of disproportionality between a sentence and severity of the crime.\\n\\nIn fact, the way the three strikes law was used in the framework of the discussed case was appropriate. Ewing was already sentenced for four crimes of the same nature and was engaged in another one. It was expected that he did not stop on the basis of this information, so the law fitted this case.\\n\\nAll in all, the man was sentenced to 25 years in prison, and his appeals did not provide him with the opportunity to alter the situation. Personally, I agree with the court뗩 decision and support it. Taking into consideration the offender뗩 long history of legal crimes, it was right to justify this sentence. It could be possible to speak about the violation of the Eighth Amendment if there was a huge gap between the punishment the crime, but it was not observed.\\n\\nEven though the primacy of the legislature and a range of various punishments is to be considered when making every decision about a case, no strict proportionality between crime and sentence is to be obligatory observed. The fact is that only the cruelest and extreme sentences are not allowed to be applied due to disproportionate, and it was not like that. What is more, due to the three strikes laws, the government is willing to reduce crimes, isolate offenders, and protect the general population.\\n\\nMoreover, it is applied only when other traditional forms of penalties turned out to be ineffective. The Constitution also provides the state and its representatives to resort to their legislatures in a case of arguable situations. Thus, on the basis of the desire to reduce recidivism, California made a decision that aligned with the committed crime.\\n'),\n",

I look to Barnard to challenge me, and I am more than ready to take on whatever comes my way. \"We\\'re competitive with ourselves, not each other.

I can only hope to have the opportunity to be a part of the flourishing Barnard sisterhood. Many schools with a campus that are located near cities say that they offer the \"best of both worlds.\" However, Barnard exceeds all of them. Barnard offers me the small liberal arts education with an enrollment of about 2500 students but also the prodigious resources of Columbia University. It provides individualized attention, small classes, and incredible research opportunities. On the other hand, it also offers me endless adventures in the cultural melting pot of New York City. I can picture myself taking advantage of free trips to the Metropolitan Museum, watching shows at Lincoln Center, and going on late night escapades to the city\\'s best restaurants.

Whatever thing man needs can only be gotten from another human being. That is the reason why we are constantly reminded that no man is an island. This means that man needs his fellow human beings in order to live a comfortable life. Although this is the case, there is the need for people to have a group of close associates whom they can identify with.\\n\\nIn most cases, this small group of friends is responsible for shaping our lives and destiny. The association that exists between friends is the most magnificent connection that one can ever have. Ideally, an ally is somebody who proffers adoration and respect and can not in any way be disloyal to us.\\n\\nOne thing that defines true friends from casual acquaintances is that while true friends are always there, acquaintances are only temporal. True friends are people who have seen you during your weakest moments but they still stick by you. In addition, these people have seen you make many silly mistakes but they nonetheless accept you unconditionally. In my life, I have had the privilege of having such kind of friends.\\n\\nThese two girls, Shannon and Stacie have been my close friends since my elementary days and this has continued to date. These two girls have seen me cranky and slumber tousled, without any make up, in scruffy clothes- all the things that I have to wear when I need to face the world and yet they have managed to stay in my life and like me as I am. To me, these two are examples of a perfect friendship.\\n\\nAnother quality of a good friendship can be exemplified in a boyfriend and a girlfriend desire to be together. The two love each other so much, such that they want to spend each waking moment of their life together. True friends also possess this kind of desire among themselves.\\n\\nJust as in the case between a girlfriend and a boyfriend, true friends avoid situations that might bring up conflicts between them. They also desist from jesting each other, but instead treat each other with deference. This is the same devotion that my friends and I have toward each other. One thing that I have realized is that together we make a strong force that can withstand any kind of pressure.\\n\\nAnother thing that best defines friends is the sacrifices that they are willing to make for each other. Good friends have been known to compromise their safety for the sake of a friend. An example of this true friendship can be found in the bible, regarding the story of Jonathan and David.\\n\\nJonathan risked losing his life by revealing the plan that the king had plotted against David. By warning him, Jonathan was not only risking the wrath of his father but was also risking losing being the heir to the throne in favor of David. However, all these things came second to his friendship with David. This clearly defines the sense and duty of a true friend.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nFriendship can mean different things to different people. However, of importance is to realize that there are different types of friends. There are the true friends who are always there for you and then there are convenient friends who are only present when they need your help.\\n\\nThe true friends are those who stand by you in both the good and the bad times. This group of friends accepts your mistakes and accepts you regardless of your condition. These people see the bright side of your life and encourage you to become more than what you are. In short, they are people who are willing to help you realize your potential in life.\\n'),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Advances in multicore processors and accelerators have opened the flood gates to greater exploration and application of machine learning techniques to a variety of applications. These advances, along with breakdowns of several trends including Moore's Law, have prompted an explosion of processors and accelerators that promise even greater computational and machine learning capabilities. These processors and accelerators are coming in many forms, from CPUs and GPUs to ASICs, FPGAs, and dataflow accelerators. This paper surveys the current state of these processors and accelerators that have been publicly announced with performance and power consumption numbers. The performance and power values are plotted on a scatter graph and a number of dimensions and observations from the trends on this plot are discussed and analyzed. For instance, there are interesting trends in the plot regarding power consumption, numerical precision, and inference versus training. We then select and benchmark two commercially-available low size, weight, and power (SWaP) accelerators as these processors are the most interesting for embedded and mobile machine learning inference applications that are most applicable to the DoD and other SWaP constrained users. We determine how they actually perform with real-world images and neural network models, compare those results to the reported performance and power consumption values and evaluate them against an Intel CPU that is used in some embedded applications.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Racial Prejudices in the United State Essay\\n\\nFirst of all let me express my enormous respect and sincere admiration to the person who managed to become the spokesman for civil rights movements, who resisted racial injustice, who championed women뗩 rights and protested the Vietnam War.\\n\\nI would like to begin with what stroke me most. It is the feeling of surprise and shock when I became aware of the injustice that Negroes experienced in the past. It was weird that the Afro-Americans who lived on the territory of the United States of America did not enjoy equal rights and freedoms with white people. It is not fair that people had to suffer from the racial prejudices and different biased opinions. Every citizen of the great country America has to be protected with the Articles and Amendments of the Constitution of the United States of America. As this document played a significant role in the establishment of democracy, considerable part and the authors contribution into the struggle of the people for independence of America and the establishment of democracy. All the people of America were looking forwards to the day when all will become equal irrespective of the social status, color of skin, religion, background or nobility. Martin Luther King was absolutely right while calling the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence 따 promissory note, as it is a document, containing a signed promise to do something. In our situation the document was not valid until present days when the United States of America became a powerful state that is the standard of democracy, the basic principles of which are stated in the Constitution. Therefore other states that want to establish democracy should follow the example of the American people of their love of principles of freedom, democracy and independence. Whereas every newborn child of America can enjoy the constitutional rights and liberties from the first moment of his/her life, most states of the world do not have such an opportunity, do not enjoy either constitutional or other rights in their country. We and the successive generations have to keep in our hearts the basic principles of freedom and democracy, because the time proved them to be the only right opinion.\\n\\nThe speech of Mr. King made me think over our relationships with people that do not look like us, speak another language; people that wake up when we go to bed as they live on the other side of the globe, people that have other customs and traditions. We can enumerate a great number of diversities that can arise between people of different countries, cultures, languages, religions, but I want to name something that is in common: a burning desire to enjoy rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution. In his speech Martin Luther King tells about his dream of happy nation, of brotherhood between different people.\\n\\nYou can disagree with my conclusion but I believe that every person has to dream of a better life, and only those who do everything possible to achieve their goals will live better. One can pray to God about wealth and fortune till kingdom come but he must at least buy a bulletin for God to be able to help him, as nothing seek, nothing find. If we cannot change the past, we can try to change the future. We can avoid such mistakes as being prejudiced towards people and their lifestyle, being unaware of people뗩 problems. If we do not know about the problem it does not mean that the problem does not exist. Martin Luther King뗩 achievements can serve as an example to successive generations. Let us not repeat the mistakes of prejudiced people.\\n'),\n",

       " Document(page_content='At a rally in his hometown of Hope, Arkansas, Mr Huckabee used the phrase \"hope to higher ground\" as a motif. The bass guitar-playing, foreign policy hawk has had a media career since losing the nomination in 2008. He joins a crowded Republican field that includes three senators, a businesswoman and a neurosurgeon. \"Folks, it is a long way from a little brick rent house on Second Street in Hope, Arkansas to the White House,\" he said. \"Here in this small town called Hope, I was raised to believe that where a person started didn\\'t mean that\\'s where he had to stop. I always believed that a kid could go from Hope to higher ground.\" After announcing his ambitions, the crowd erupted in cheers of \"We want Mike!\" The former Southern Baptist minister acknowledged his pro-gun-ownership position, telling the audience about receiving a BB gun at the age of five. He said the US Department of Education should be abolished, a position popular with conservatives who oppose recent national education reforms. On immigration, he said the US borders should be secured, but was short on details. And he reaffirmed his steadfast opposition to same-sex marriage. Mike Huckabee is back. Eight years ago he launched a surprisingly successful presidential bid, finishing second to Arizona Senator John McCain and winning the Iowa caucuses and seven other states. Four years ago rumours abounded that Mr Huckabee was going to run again. Supporters and analysts watched and waited.... and waited. The former Arkansas governor, who had a well-paying job as a television and radio host, opted to sit out the campaign, despite some polls showing him leading the Republican field. He said his \"heart says no.\" Now, however, Mr Huckabee\\'s heart is saying yes. He has quit his media commitments and is diving into the 2016 race. He\\'ll meet a much more crowded field than would have faced him in 2012, however, both in the total number of candidates and in opponents who will compete with him for the evangelical voters who buoyed his 2008 campaign. Mr Huckabee has a lot going for him - name recognition, a developed fundraising network and experience from his previous presidential campaign. But given the strength of his Republican opponents - new, engaging and also well-funded - will that be enough? Early in his speech, Mr Huckabee noted that he was the first male in his family to graduate from high school. \"My dad wasn\\'t an educated man, but he was a smart man. And he and my mother didn\\'t have a whole lot, but they had honesty to the bone,\" he said. As his campaign gets under way, Mr Huckabee could face challenges within his own party. Many conservatives will not like the fact that overall, taxes and spending went up during his time as Arkansas governor. In 2008, Mr Huckabee won eight primaries in socially conservative states but this time he has vowed to focus more on the economy and national security. To win the Republican crown, he will have to overcome Senators Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, as well as former Hewlett-Packard boss Carly Fiorina and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Jeb Bush has not officially announced but is the frontrunner in the party.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The United States and South Africa뗩 Trade Row Essay (Article)\\n\\nThe United States and South Africa are involved in a conflict that is risking the stability of trade relationships between them. President Barrack Obama has threatened to withdraw duty-free status for South African agricultural commodities within 2 months if it does not abolish several trade barriers it has imposed against the U.S (Rampton and Hughes par. 1). The duty-free status is part of a program that the U.S. implemented to help African exporters conduct trade.\\n\\nSouth Africa has imposed poultry imports from the United States because of a bird flu outbreak that occurred last year (Rampton and Hughes par. 2). The ban has made it worse for American traders because of an ongoing heavy-duty policy on certain poultry products. The United States Trade Representative Michael Froman has said that it is important for South Africa to abolish the barriers for better trade relationships between the two countries (Rampton and Hughes par. 4).\\n\\nFailure to revoke the barriers will put South Africa at risk of losing its membership in the African Growth and Eligibility Act (AGOA) trade program. One of the criteria for AGOA membership is the eradication of trade barriers to U.S trade and investment (Rampton and Hughes par. 6). AGOA members enjoy duty-free access to commodities to countries in the sub-Saharan region. The president of the National Chicken Council has supported the sentiments presented by Froman.\\n\\nHe argues that the U.S. should not give preferences to nations that treat it unfairly by imposing trade barriers. South Africa benefits from trading with the U.S. For example, it exported agricultural products worth $176 million last year (Rampton and Hughes par. 8). If the ban is implemented, the export of many products will be affected and the country will incur great losses.\\n\\nSignificance in a global setting\\n\\nInternational trade is one of the most important pillars of the global economy. Trade between countries facilitates the exchange of goods and services, foreign exchange creates employment, and enhances international relations. Trade barriers between countries prevent them from utilizing their resources in a manner that gives them a competitive advantage and numerous market opportunities. South Africa risks losing significantly if it fails to revoke the trade barriers it has sanctioned against the United States. It is estimated that South Africa exports about $250 million worth of agricultural products to the United States annually.\\n\\nTrade relationships with the U.S are valuable opportunities that allow South Africa to earn foreign exchange through the export of its products, exploitation of market opportunities, and reduce costs of conducting trade. Besides, it allows the country to compete effectively with other countries that export similar products to the U.S. Revoking the trade barriers is a strategy that can benefit South Africa greatly and provide an opportunity for competitive advantage with countries outside the sub-Saharan region that export similar agricultural products to the United States. The conflict will affect international trade significantly and international relations between the two countries.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nRampton, Roberta, and Krista Hughes.

Initially, he dismissed the idea that he was an extremist; however, later, he redefined that label. Dr. King critically evaluated the two opposing sides, which were the radicals and the complacent (Burrow 17).\\n\\nAs applied to the latter group, he defined them as those 띿rained of self-respect and a sense of somebodiness (King 4). He further noted that true extremists were the participants of the different black nationalist groups. He stressed that extremists were promoting violence and racist behavior against the white members of the population. This way, he positioned himself amid black America.\\n\\nFurther in the letter, Dr. King embraced the label and added a positive connotation to it. In particular, he 랂ained a bit of satisfaction from being considered an extremist (King 4). He discussed multiple examples of when political or spiritual leaders were considered extremists. For example, he called Jesus Christ an extremist 랁or love (King 4). King also mentioned that Thomas Jefferson was considered an extremist for fighting for universal rights.\\n\\nBy providing these examples, Dr. King illustrated that creative extremism was the power capable of accelerating progress. By redefining the label, he was capable of rising above the people criticizing such a worldview.\\n\\nImportantly, the discussion of the label pushed King to reflect on the term 랈oderate. These were the people who were not eager to fight or ignored racial inequality. A moderate 랋refers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice (King 3). According to King, such people were afraid of any action. This meant that they engaged in deliberate ignorance, which implied racial malice. Therefore, such people were trying to disguise their true motive (Stearns 175). By contrasting the two opposing sides, Dr. King put the reasoning behind each position to the forefront.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nBurrow, Rufus, Jr. Extremist for Love: Martin Luther King Jr., Man of Ideas and Nonviolent Social Action .

It gutted one house and badly damaged two others. No-one was injured, but two dogs died as the fire spread. At this stage police have said they are not treating the fire as suspicious. Fire station commander William Weir said five pumps were brought in to bring it under control. \"On arrival the first crews found two houses well alight and the fire spreading either side of them along a row of five terrace houses,\" he said. \"It quickly became apparent that there was an oil tank involved which had allowed its contents to ignite which spread to a second oil tank in the house next door which then further added fuel to quite a large fire. \"The fuel then followed through the gardens of the remaining houses in the street and set fire to a further six garden sheds and some fencing. \"It was quite a large fire and it took crews approximately 35 to 40 minutes of hard fire fighting to stop it spreading to the other properties and to bring it under control and extinguish it.\" Mr Weir said an investigation by the fire service and police had concluded that the blaze had started accidentally. \"Basically what happened was that some rubbish in the garden which had been burnt earlier in the day and left unattended re-ignited and set fire to a fence and then compromised the oil tank allowing its contents to become involved in the fire and from then the fire grew in intensity,\" he added.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Have you ever thought about a computer reading your emotions? me neither, that sounds pretty cool huh. Well today its possible for your emotions to be read by new technology called \"the Facial Action Coding System\" created by Dr. Paul Eckman, this allows computers to recognize human emotions. I believe that this new technology can change things and improve the relationship between computers and humans.\\n\\nNow lets take it back to Leonardo da Vinci and his Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa. Da Vinci studied human anatomy to help him paint muscles on the face as precisely as possible to show specific emotions. This painting was the first to be tested on this new software, yes a painting not real physical human face. The result showed hat Mona Lisa was 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. The whole process of calculating emotions begins with a computer constructed 3-D model of the being identified, the 44 important muscles have to move like human muscles. the movement of one or muscles is called a \"action unit\".\\n\\nDr. Eckman has classified the six basic emotions which are; Happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Dr. Haung says in this passage that \"the facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression (like not smiling as broadly)\". humans calculate emotions everyday, you can tell when your friend is mad, sad, tired just by looking at their face. but not everyone can some people have trouble reading facial expressions on people.\\n\\nThink about a computer knowing your exact emotion. For example when your doing an assignment that requires you to do research and the computer can tell that your getting bored with the website that you found by indentifiying your emotions at the moment, it could give you other sites that might interest you.

       " Document(page_content=\"In this world many of us make decisions by ourselves and others seek guidance to make decisions in their life. While some people argue that people should seek guidance to make decisions in their life, but I think it is more beneficial if people make their own decisions because if people make their own decisions they will develop their self confidence and they will become responsible person. Also, if people make their own decisions they will have happier life in the the future.\\n\\nIt's true that by making our own decisions that we will develop our self confidence and become responsible person. If person make decision that decision might be hard, after making the decision the person will develop his or hers self confidence and they will become responsible for the decision that they made. For example, if one person decides to leave his parents house to live by his own, he will be responsible for himself because he decided not to live with his parents no more. This will help him to be responsible person because he has to take care of himself by his own. Another example can be, In school, Students choose their classes for next year by themselves. This will help them to develop their self confidence because they are deciding what is better for them or not by their own. Also, this will help them to decide and have a confidence in what they will major in the future. So, by making our own decisions we can develop our self confidence and become responsible person.\\n\\nSecondly, It's also true that by making our own decisions we will be happy and have happier life. When people make important decisions by themselves and if they achieve their goal by making this decision they will become happy and they can have happier life. For instance, if one student decided not to go college, instead he wanted to become a soccer player. If the student worked hard and become a professional soccer player he will be happy and will have happier life because he decided to become a professional soccer player by himself instead of going college. Additionally, In school, When I was sophomore, I was choosing classes for next year and I decided to take classes that I thought that are important for me and that can help me for college. Then when I take the classes this year I was very happy of my decision because this classes helped me a lot. So, people should make their own decision because they will be happy and have happier life by the decision they made.\\n\\nOn the other hand, some people argue that people should seek guidance to make decisions in their life because it helps them not to make wrong decisions, but I think that is wrong because if you always seek guidance to make decision in your life the decision that you made may not satisfy you in your future life. For example, if your parents advice you to make decision to become a doctor and if you made a decision to be a doctor by listening your parents ,in the future you might have bad life because being a doctor might not be part of your life. Also, you will experience difficulties in your life because your decision is influenced by others. So, people should make their own decision because it helps them to become better self confident person. By making our own decision we can gain a lot in our life.\\n\\nFinally, people should make their own decision because it will help them to develop their self confidence and to become a better person by being responsible.

This means that under the legal system, any and all possible forms of consensual, legitimate marriage would not be barred by the state. I would, however also support the rights of the church to deny any couples as they see fit, there are a number of christian denominations (for example) that are willing to marry homosexual couples, but those churches and denominations that choose not to do so will have their religious freedom respected. Likewise, though i am not religious in any way, from my limited research it appears that polygamy is permitted under a number of religions (Mormonism, Islam, smaller african and asian religions, some independent christians). So in a sense, by keeping things the way they are we are actually serving to infringe upon religious freedom, as well as unnecessarily infringing upon personal freedom between multiple consenting adults in a personal relationship that is of no concern to the state or external individuals.

It specifically points out the inherent weaknesses in the UAE뗩 defamation law. Even though I support the clause that forbids individuals from taking other people뗩 photos without their consent, all other clauses on defamation are somewhat retrogressive in the 21 st century. The clause that criminalises verbal abuses or gestures even in the absence of a witness is in bad taste. Conventionally, suspects should remain innocent until proven guilty through the due process of the law, which demands proof beyond any reasonable doubt before convicting anyone.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the defamation laws in the UAE are one-sided, as they favour the accuser. For instance, the burden of proof is solely the work of the accused, as one has to prove that the allegations levelled against him/her are false. Sadly, truth is not a guarantee that the accused will be vindicated. Similarly, the defamation law impede the gains of social media as all Internet platforms are considered as public forums and so one can be sued for posting anything that borders on defamation. The defamation law should be amended to accommodate the diversity of the UAE.\\n\\nThe case of the Canadian woman defaming the Jumeirah International Kindergarten raises two critical questions concerning defamation in Dubai. The first question touches on whether the Canadian woman committed defamation by fabricating the incidence. The second question explores whether the Canadian woman would have committed defamation by sending emails to other parents with kids in the kindergarten if the incidence were true.\\n\\nIn the first case, the Canadian woman is guilty of defamation and the Dubai Court of Misdemeanours acted appropriately by charging her with defamation because she fabricated the story. Her intentions were malicious, hence criminal because she sought to cause harm to the kindergarten. In the second case, the accused would still be guilty as the right channel of handing such an incidence is to report to the police for them to take the appropriate actions within the stipulations of the law. As stipulated in the defamation law, truth alone is not a guaranteed defence in a court of law if the content can potentially damage the defamed party. Therefore, even if the incidence were true and the accused saw her son being hit as alleged, that truth alone could not vindicate her because her action of sending slanderous emails amounts to defamation.\\n'),\n",

Also, through marching band I encountered Arts, beauty of intellectual pursuit, when I was taught the beauty of the values of being diligent in everything that I do. The first day of band camp was my first encounter of the traditions that I would take part in during my years in marching band. I was thrust into a flurry of section spirit as each of the sections had. In the percussion pit we had traditions such as the section leader giving us all a little talk before each performance or going out to eat after playing in the football games. Not only did I form traditions with my fellow pit members, but I also found friends amongst the other sections and formed traditions like going to laser quest after a competition and having a party to watch the marching band season DVD. Throughout the experience we formed relationships with each other that lasted far after the marching band seasons ended. Marching band has shown me the values of having character and enjoying the traditions that I became a part of. Along with creating new traditions and friends, marching band has taught me the importance of doing my best in everything that I do. During marching band there are so many things to juggle including memorizing the music and mastering the form of playing in unison with one another.

The satisfaction of getting the show to near perfection helped me see that diligence and hard work does make a difference to how you live your everyday life.

Mikey Jack, 19, who plays Sunday league football with Mr Reape, said: \"A lot of people here don\\'t really know Kevin or Sian but they just want to help any way they can.\" Another volunteer, college student Tizanne Gregory, 17, added: \"I came here today in the hope of finding Sian. \"I\\'m just hoping we can do anything to help her parents and it is horrible not knowing where she is.\" A police spokesman said Miss O\\'Callaghan had an LG E900 Optimus mobile phone and asked for anyone who finds one to contact the force. CCTV footage of Miss O\\'Callaghan alone in the nightclub has been released in the hope that it will jog revellers\\' memories. The black and white footage shows her walking downstairs and outside through the club\\'s entrance, past a small group of men. A police spokesman said the times shown on the CCTV were about six minutes slow. He urged anyone who remembered seeing Miss O\\'Callaghan to contact the force. Her disappearance has been described as totally out of character. More than 60 police officers are working on the investigation which is being treated as a missing person inquiry. Det Supt Steve Fulcher said: \"Sian left Suju and walked along the High Street in Old Town and there were a number of vehicles moving through the High Street between 2.55am to 3am. \"We would like to identify the people in those vehicles as possible witnesses. \"I\\'d also like to hear from anyone who saw any vehicles in or near beauty spots between Swindon and Savernake between 3am and 4am. \"It is very important that people come forward as they may have vital information which will help us to find Sian.\" At a news conference on Monday, her boyfriend Kevin Reape, who shared a flat with Miss O\\'Callaghan, appealed for information to help find her. A Wiltshire Police spokesman said Mr Reape was not being treated as a suspect in Miss O\\'Callaghan\\'s disappearance. Also present at the news conference were Miss O\\'Callaghan\\'s parents Mick, 51, and Elaine, 48, brother Liam, 24, and sister Lora, 19.'),\n",

I can still recall the memory when my parents told me and my elder brother that we were going to boarding school. My brother was in grade two at that time, and I was in kindergarten, both of us were excited not really knowing what a boarding school was. I was very enthusiastic because I got new toys and clothes. All I thought about was the playground and lots of chips and chocolates. Being just a five-year-old, I would cry all the time, I didn't know how to do even the simplest things. But not having my mom around I learned to do things on my own. Since a very young age, I have learned to be independent and make decisions on my own as people will never be around to do it for me. Staying at a place with people of different age groups helped me learn things faster, like for instance, when I first went there, I wouldn't speak in English but only within a month I was able to converse in English as if it was my first language, staying in a particular place can have a huge influence. When I went home during my first vacation, I spoke to everyone in English as staying in school I forgot my native language! Sometimes, I think if I was at home I don't think I would have been able to become independent. India is a vast country with a very diverse culture, if someone went to a different state it would feel like a whole different country as each state has its own culture and language. The students in my school were from different states, so there were differences but staying there with everyone, it helped me to learn to be nonjudgmental and respect differences. As without differences, there isn't any learning.\"),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Utilitarianism: John Stuart Mill and Jeremy Bentham Essay\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n 1. Introduction\\n 2. Qualitative and Quantitative Happiness\\n 3. Pushkin vs. Pushpin\\n 4. Societal Stand\\n 5. Sources\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThis paper is about the different view points of John Stuart Mill and Jeremy Bentham on the concept of Utilitarianism. Though Mill뗩 work was influenced by Bentham to a large extent, nonetheless there are significant differences in their approach that we discuss here. Mill and Bentham occupy a unique place among the philosophers and thinkers of the Enlightenment era with regards to their conceptions of utilitarianism.\\n\\nQualitative and Quantitative Happiness\\n\\nThe main difference between Mill뗩 and Bentham뗩 conception of Utilitarianism is that Mill, though a consequentialist, makes a case for the qualitative aspects of happiness. Bentham뗩 case on the other hand is the one for the 랂reatest happiness of all. Thus, one needs to act in such a way that promotes the happiness of the maximum number of people. For Bentham, all kinds of happiness are equal whereas for Mill, there is a subtle element of difference in the degree and kind of pleasure that we get from our actions.\\n\\nBentham뗩 concept is known as Hedonistic Utilitarianism where he postulates that the greatest happiness of the greatest number should form the basis for our conduct in society. Mill, on the other hand, drew a line between individual happiness and happiness of all by stating that 랑e should do what we like and without impediment from our fellow creatures. However, he qualifies this statement with 라s long as we do not do them harm. Further, the sense of personal sacrifice that is so revered in the Christian conception of things can be seen as an objection to Mill뗩 theory. However, Mill discounts this by stating that any sacrifice that denies happiness of self and also does not promote the general sense of well being is considered a waste.\\n\\nPushkin vs. Pushpin\\n\\nA significant difference that follows from the section above is what is ultimately good for society. According to Mill뗩 theory, it is the qualitative separation of happiness that counts and so a 랃igher pleasure is better than a 랇ower pleasure. In his own work, it is better for Socrates to be dissatisfied rather than a fool satisfied and 락etter for a human to be satisfied than a pig satisfied. Bentham, on the other hand does not seek a qualitative separation of happiness and says that a Pushpin is as better as an Opera house the allusion being to the children뗩 game that can promote happiness to the maximum number of individuals as opposed to an opera house for the select few. Mill would have certainly favored building more opera houses or rather Pushkin over Pushpin. Mill뗩 views can be read as an expression of what is now known as libertarian ideology whereas Bentham뗩 ideas can be construed as the modern welfare economics and the welfare state that places collective good over individuals.\\n\\nSocietal Stand\\n\\nBentham proposed several legal and social reforms that were in line with his principle of the 랂reater happiness and is credited with having developed a body of thought that would encompass and provide grounding for the same. On the other hand, Mill supported legislation that favored special privileges for university graduates and it needs to be mentioned that the above reading of Utilitarianism should not detract us from the fact that Mill was not against uneducated people and that his stand was that education was important than the intrinsic value that educated people enjoyed.\\n\\nSources\\n\\nTheodore C.

       " Document(page_content=\"In this world many of us make decisions by ourselves and others seek guidance to make decisions in their life. While some people argue that people should seek guidance to make decisions in their life, but I think it is more beneficial if people make their own decisions because if people make their own decisions they will develop their self confidence and they will become responsible person. Also, if people make their own decisions they will have happier life in the the future.\\n\\nIt's true that by making our own decisions that we will develop our self confidence and become responsible person. If person make decision that decision might be hard, after making the decision the person will develop his or hers self confidence and they will become responsible for the decision that they made. For example, if one person decides to leave his parents house to live by his own, he will be responsible for himself because he decided not to live with his parents no more. This will help him to be responsible person because he has to take care of himself by his own. Another example can be, In school, Students choose their classes for next year by themselves. This will help them to develop their self confidence because they are deciding what is better for them or not by their own. Also, this will help them to decide and have a confidence in what they will major in the future. So, by making our own decisions we can develop our self confidence and become responsible person.\\n\\nSecondly, It's also true that by making our own decisions we will be happy and have happier life. When people make important decisions by themselves and if they achieve their goal by making this decision they will become happy and they can have happier life. For instance, if one student decided not to go college, instead he wanted to become a soccer player. If the student worked hard and become a professional soccer player he will be happy and will have happier life because he decided to become a professional soccer player by himself instead of going college. Additionally, In school, When I was sophomore, I was choosing classes for next year and I decided to take classes that I thought that are important for me and that can help me for college. Then when I take the classes this year I was very happy of my decision because this classes helped me a lot. So, people should make their own decision because they will be happy and have happier life by the decision they made.\\n\\nOn the other hand, some people argue that people should seek guidance to make decisions in their life because it helps them not to make wrong decisions, but I think that is wrong because if you always seek guidance to make decision in your life the decision that you made may not satisfy you in your future life. For example, if your parents advice you to make decision to become a doctor and if you made a decision to be a doctor by listening your parents ,in the future you might have bad life because being a doctor might not be part of your life. Also, you will experience difficulties in your life because your decision is influenced by others. So, people should make their own decision because it helps them to become better self confident person. By making our own decision we can gain a lot in our life.\\n\\nFinally, people should make their own decision because it will help them to develop their self confidence and to become a better person by being responsible. Also, by making their own decision they will have a better life in the future. People should make their own decision to become better person by achieving their goals. Additionally, peoples have to make a decision by themselves because they can gain a lot in their life.                \"),\n",

I was actually happy to finally be getting this fixed. And then I drove away. My car now shakes whenever I hit the brakes. Never has it done that before. My admitted mistake was not turning right back around, but I had shit to do. So time passes, and the shaking has subsided a bit. But it was still bothering me, and I finally had a minute to take it back to have them check on it, as the man politely offered if I had any problems. The main thing I have to point out on my second (and last) visit to this place was the (same) guy's attitude, which I felt the second I walked in. Before I even said a word to him, I knew that I was not going to leave happy. I explained my problem, and he took my car back and said I need new rotors. Wow, now how did I know they would tell me it was something completely unrelated to the work they did before? I must be god damn psychic. I also wondered why there was no mention of this last time. I was told everything was fine. Needless to say, I said no thanks. He didn't offer me a deal, and certainly no sympathy. Just your average mechanic attitude that I've dealt with many a time. Nothing we can do, sucker, unless you wanna shell out more money! I've often wondered how shops that pull this kind of shit stay in business.

My daughter was in from out of town and requested we go here because I would not have chosen True Food again. We were seated at a table with food all over the floor underneath and a menu laying there as well. We waited 10 min and many server walked by us but no one acknowledged us. I finally got up and went to the receptionist to ask if our table could be cleaned and if we could see a server. Our server let us know he was eating his dinner....really? My daughter ordered the tacos vegetarian with tofu, I ordered a salad. My daughter began with a field green salad for 4. This salad is only lettuce, like TF dumped out a cup of mixed field green out of a bag. I had to continually stop other servers for more ice or more ice tea. When our server would approach the table he was still chewing from eating his dinner. When our entrees were served they did not bring my daughters. I had to flag down several servers to check on her order. Our server was nowhere in site since he was enjoying his dinner. My daughters tacos had only a cabbage mix, no tofu, nothing else.

       " Document(page_content='Shana Grice, 19, was found with her throat cut in her bedroom at her Brighton home in August 2016. Her ex-boyfriend Michael Lane, 27, of Portslade, had placed a tracker device on her car, Lewes Crown Court heard. Miss Grice contacted police several times about Lane\\'s unwanted attention before she died. The police watchdog has begun an investigation. A statement by her mother, Sharon Grice, read out in court by counsel, said: \"We firmly believe her murder could have been avoided if her fears had been taken seriously by police. \"Michael Lane had been harassing, stalking and pressurising her for over a year. Her life became a nightmare which we believe had affected her mental and physical health. \"The brutal death of our daughter has ruined our lives forever. We have become mere shells of our former selves.\" Speaking after the verdict, Deputy Chief Constable of Sussex Police, Bernie O\\'Reilly, said the force had apologised to the Grice family. \"When we looked at the circumstances leading to Shana\\'s murder, we felt we may not have done the very best we could,\" he said. During the two-week trial, Lane admitted he had stalked Miss Grice and had lied to police in interviews, but denied murder. He had claimed he found her body and left her home without raising the alarm because he was in shock. But the jury returned its guilty verdict after just over two hours of deliberation. The court heard Lane refused to accept their break-up and was incensed when Miss Grice rekindled her relationship with ex-boyfriend Ashley Cooke, vowing to a friend: \"She\\'ll pay for what she\\'s done.\" Prosecutor Philip Bennetts QC said: \"During their relationship, he stalked her. He put a tracker on her car and followed her movements. \"That obsession with her translated into killing her. He would not allow anyone else to be with her.\" Two days before Miss Grice was killed, she met Lane at a hotel in Hove to insist their relationship was over, but Lane claimed they had sex earlier that day. The evening before he killed her, he filled a red petrol can with fuel, but claimed he bought it to kill himself due to depression following his grandfather\\'s death. The car mechanic waited until she was alone at the bungalow she shared with two housemates before cutting her throat and trying to set fire to her room. Prosecutors said one fire was started on the bed and another on the carpet, and Lane dismantled the smoke alarm in the hallway. After the killing, Lane withdrew PS60 from Miss Grice\\'s bank account and went to check a lottery ticket before he went to work at SE Tyres in Burgess Hill, where he was arrested. He is due to be sentenced on Thursday. Mr Justice Green warned Lane he faces a life sentence with a \"very substantial minimum term.\" During the trial, the the court heard Miss Grice complained about her ex-boyfriend to police several times. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is conducting an investigation into the contact between Miss Grice, Mr Lane and Sussex Police in the lead-up to her death. Mr O\\'Reilly said: \"Within days of her murder I personally visited Shana\\'s family to apologise on behalf of Sussex Police and we made a referral to the IPCC. \"We have thoroughly reviewed all aspects of how we deal with cases of stalking and harassment and we have now taken on the learning and our approach is more robust.\" An IPCC spokesman said investigators had already interviewed a number of witnesses and further interviews would be carried out now the trial had finished.'),\n",

       " Document(page_content='The Suitability of the Death Penalty Essay\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nPeople뗩 behaviours are controlled by laws that ensure that they respect the rights of other people while enjoying the freedom granted to them by their constitutions. Those that cannot obey laws are punished according to the degree of their crimes. Criminal justice systems have established various ways of categorising crimes according to their severity and intentions.\\n\\nMinor offenders face lenient criminal sentences while capital offenders face major ones like life imprisonment or the death penalty. This essay explores the suitability of the capital punishment as an effective way of deterring other criminals from committing heinous crimes. This punishment is an appropriate method of keeping capital crimes at bay due to the following advantages associated with it.\\n\\nCapital punishment refers to all sentences that are granted to criminals to ensure they serve maximum time in prison. They include the death sentence or life sentences that are common in most developed nations. This is an effective way of punishing capital offenders and deterring other criminals from committing similar crimes due to the following reasons.\\n\\nFirst, it is necessary to state that people fear death. In addition, they fear being denied the freedom to associate with their friends, family members and the public. Therefore, once they witness other criminals being sentenced to life imprisonment they will never wish to go through the same experience.\\n\\nIt is true that people learn from what their friends experience and thus criminals will not want to go through the same pain experienced by those who commit capital crimes. They will desist from committing these crimes and they may even stop their criminal activities. This punishment deters other criminals from committing capital crimes.\\n\\nSecondly, this punishment ensures that criminals do not get in touch with the rest of the population. This means that other petty offenders and would be criminals will not be taught these crimes. It is necessary to state that bad company will not be entertained in the society since these criminals will be in prison or dead.\\n\\nThere will be no one to teach other people about these crimes. This will ensure that there will be no capital offenders or they will be less compared to if this sentence is not implemented. Socialisation is one way that young people learn different things from other members of the society. When a criminal is allowed lenient punishments, the person will go back to the society after serving their sentences and they will commit similar crimes again.\\n\\nLastly, this sentence is a punishment and not a rehabilitation project and once it is administered there is no way the criminal will come back to life. This means that the probability of a similar crime to be committed is zero. It is important to state that when a person dies the process cannot be reversed. Therefore, it has no equal and people will always tend to move away from people associated with murder and capital crimes. This punishment will ensure other criminals desist from committing capital crimes.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nCapital punishments were designed to deter people from committing capital crimes like murder, robbery with violence, child molestation, and rape. The sentence discourages people from committing the above crimes since they fear death. It is a painful experience and criminals sentenced will never get opportunities to influence others to commit these crimes. Therefore, this is a good way of ensuring heinous crimes are not committed in the society.\\n'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='1. People find many ways to express their inner world. Some write novels; others paint, perform, or debate; still others design elegant solutions to complex mathematical problems. How do you express your inner world, and how does the world around you respond? Music is inherent in my soul, and this ardor for rhythm is what led me to take up Indian cultural dance, which focuses on capturing the spirit of music and translating this through movements and expressions. Indian dance focuses just as much on acting as it does on actual content, and I love that I am able to portray a different character with different emotions in each dance. Before I began dancing, I never thought that I could experience true happiness through my own actions, but I now understand that as long as I am dancing, I will be content, and I only hope to continually relay this joy to my audience. Ultimately, dance has taught me what passion truly is. It has taken a lot for me to share my passion with the world, but I am thoroughly glad I have. In the sixth grade, I performed an Indian dance for our school talent show, but before doing so, I worried that my dance would be considered \"weird\" and that I would be labeled the same. At that time, Indian culture was not as popular in the media as it is today, so exposing children to something so foreign was a big risk. However, the risk completely paid off! My classmates loved the movements, expressions, and music and developed a greater appreciation and respect for me and my culture. This experience has inspired me to continue sharing my passion and to introduce others to a beautiful world outside their own.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Britain used to trade for tea, but the shipping and the series of middlemen made tea much too expensive for the masses. Then they took over India, causing supply to go up and price to go down, and all the middle class and then poor people wanted to try a taste of the \"rich man\\'s drink.\" Eventually tea stopped being something you drank to look posh and became a regular part of the diet. This ties in with the temperance push in the UK during the 1800s. People quit drinking beer and took up tea. Now britons consume both.\\', \"Us Brits drink a lot of tea, but I don\\'t really think many teens drink it. Maybe first thing in the morning, or late afternoon to relax, but not like 8 cups a day or such.,As one who is about to leave his teenage years, I can confirm that I and most of my friends drink a lot of tea. Tea and coffee are round about equally popular in Britain.\\', \"The Irish actually drink more tea than us, in reality more coffee is drunk here than tea but we have a much more emotional relationship to tea in general, especially because of the near impossibility of getting a decent cup of it in many foreign climes. Some people don\\'t drink it, in my experience these tend to be the same people who don\\'t drink coffee either. Small children don\\'t drink it but I\\'d say around 80 to 90 of people start drinking it in their teenage years (often the first year of university) and then drink it regularly throughout adulthood. Coffee and tea came to dominate British cultural life as healthy alternatives to alcohol whilst water was still unsanitary to drink. Tea, being generally cheaper and having a more gradual energy release has always been a more working-class, domestic drink. It has connotations of comfort and familiarity, so that whilst most people actually drink coffee more often, they will have more positive feelings about tea. Coffee is for the stressful morning rush, tea is for sitting in front of the telly of an evening. It is also a fabulous hang-over remedy.,It started as a sort of high class drink that was showing off that you could afford tea, then it gradually became cheaper and everybody could afford it. Now its become a social thing, if someone comes to your house you offer them a cup of tea, it shows them that you are willing to do more for them then just get a glass of water (tea takes more time to make then a glass of water) and it shows you are happy for them to linger a while at your house, tea takes a while to drink. On top of that its a relaxing drink and makes their stay seem less formal. Accepting is like saying you are willing to stay at their house for a while and that you are willing to relax at their house (you trust themdon\\'t feel uncomfortable around them) So basically if a British person offers you a cup of tea say yes:P (If they offer you a biscuit or \"cookie\" they really like you\" PS I\\'m British\\', \"It\\'s sort of like American pizza. It can be really good, or really bad. There are varying opinions on how to make it correctly: milk first or water first? New York style or Chicago deep dish?

The author does not clearly tell that he was in love with her, but the readers can see that she definitely produced a long-lasting impression on him.\\n\\nIt should be noted that She dwelt among the untrodden Ways is one of the so-called Lucy poems, dedicated to an unknown woman whose identity was never fully disclosed (Kumar, 2003, p. 229).\\n\\nOne of themes that Wordsworth explores is the idea that beauty can often go unrecognized by others; however, other people뗩 recognition is unnecessary for a person who can appreciate beauty.\\n\\nThe imagery of the poem, its language, and structure are the main elements that help the author to convey his meaning and feelings for Lucy.\\n\\nOne of the things that catch the attention of the reader is the metaphors that Wordsworth uses. For instance, he compares this woman to 라 violet by a mossy stone half hidden from the eye (Wordsworth, 2008, p. 167).\\n\\nIn this way, the author shows that the beauty of this person could be unnoticed by many people. Yet, this image also implies that for the narrator, this woman stood out among many others because a violet definitely contrasts with mossy stones.\\n\\nYet, the readers know that this beauty was certainly recognized by the narrator because he compares her to a lonely 랍tar (Wordsworth, 2008, p. 167).\\n\\nAgain this metaphor implies that for Wordsworth Lucy represents the greatness of nature (Walz, 2007, p. 26). This is how the author emphasizes the beauty of this person, at least in his view.\\n\\nAnother linguistic element that is worth discussing is the use of understatements or the expressions that state something in very restraint form.\\n\\nFor instance, he does not simply say she died. Instead the author chooses the expression 띾eased to be (Wordsworth, 2008, p. 167). Thus, the narrator shows that Lucy was a strong presence in his life, and her very existence was very important to him.\\n\\nFurthermore, the speaker does not mention his sorrow and the feeling of loss. Instead he says that her death was 랎he difference to him (Wordsworth, 2008, p. 167).\\n\\nIn this way, Wordsworth seems to suggest that his feelings for this woman and his sorrow may not be expressed with the help of words. This is one of the key ideas of this poem.\\n\\nFurthermore, one should not disregard such a literary element as the structure of the poem. It can be divided into three parts or stanzas and they symbolize the development, perfection and fading of beauty and love (Kumar, 2003, p. 229).\\n\\nThe first stanza describes the environment in which this woman grew up. The readers can see that Lucy grew up in a very inconspicuous where very few people could appreciate her beauty.\\n\\nThe second stanza shows how her beauty was discovered and what it meant for the narrator, while the third passage shows the impact that the death of this woman produced on the narrator.\\n\\nOverall, William Wordsworth뗩 poem shows that beauty often exists only in the eyes of the beholder. As a rule, it does not require acknowledgement of other people.\\n\\nThe author shows that Lucy deeply affected his life and creative work, even though other people did not pay much attention to her.\\n\\nThe main strength of this poem is that the author expressed his feelings for this woman by using very concise language and powerful imagery.\\n\\nReference List\\n\\nKumar, S.

       " Document(page_content=\"Also, something I would like to talk about in the other essay is my struggle with mental illness. However, I have been advised against this by some because it will apparently make me seem weak and not ready for college. Any opinions on this? This is a fairly important part of my life that I have learned a lot from, after all. In anthropology, there is a term often used to describe the 'old' techniques. Aptly named 'armchair anthropology', it refers to when anthropologists were all white men who sat around and 'theorized' about the exotic brown people and what they were like. They rarely ever had first-hand experience with their 'subject' of study, and they certainly did not particularly try to relate to them. Instead, they read books and judged their subjects on the basis of their own culture-for example, a person from a society where tattoos are taboo would consider a tattooed individual barbaric, even if in that individual's own society to be tattooed is acceptable for a variety of reasons. This is called ethnocentrism, believing your culture to be the 'right' one. While academically this is outdated and 'relativism' anthropology is the norm (studying a culture based on its own values, not on another's), judging others on your own values is still a problem I often see in today's society, leading to many conflicts. However, I was lucky in that 'relativism' was instilled in me since the day I was born, and am able to view people and their actions without including me in the picture. Growing up, I was the only white Jewish child in a mostly Mexican and Asian community. While stories like these, growing up the only something in a community of something else, usually end badly, I was extremely fortunate in only having a wonderful experience. Growing up, I gained a fascination with people. Why did they act the way they did? What did they believe? What differentiates one person from another? These questions in my head might have led me to an interest in psychology if I did not grow up with so many people with diverse identities. What began to interest me more than the actual people themselves were their backgrounds. While all people are different, the culture they grow up in (such as ethnicity) or have come to be part of (such as sexuality) has a profound effect on them as well. In my short life so far, I have seen people who have embraced, rejected, been ambivalent about, been hurt, and more by their identities. From a friend who found healing in religion to another who had depression partly caused by the same religion, culture in all its forms is such an important part of our lives. For this reason, I want to understand it. My goal in this life is to understand what makes people do what they do, and anthropology has been my source for understanding since I was young and learning why people spoke different languages to now, when I analyze why different groups sit together in the cafeteria. When I was able to stop a group of friends (white, Asian and Mexican) from judging a group of other students who were African American for mostly staying together rather than branching out, I felt I had done a little more to increase understanding. What I want to do with this understanding is what people of all academic disciplines want to do: help make the world a better place. I want to do this by making people understand each other and be able to solve problems with this strategy. To accomplish this would be immensely more satisfying than all the money in the world.\"),\n",

       " Document(page_content='The Oil and gas industry is lagging behind in the use of data for more profitable and efficient production; for data to be a true asset, it must be identified, aggregated, stored, analyzed and perfected hence, the need for data scientists and analysts. The Nigeria oil and gas industry provides more than 90% of the country\\'s export and 80% of the government revenue hence the need to optimize production and increase performances across board. As a graduate of Mathematics, I developed a fascination towards data which prompt me to secure a job as a data enter officer; during these period, I have tried to better myself attending online courses on data analysis which has enlightened and broaden my horizon as to the need for data analysts and scientists in all sector for improved performances. This fascination of mine turned passion has fuelled my interest to apply for the Petroleum Technology Development Fund(PTDF) scholarship to obtain a masters (M.Sc.) degree in Data Science at the University of Salford. I am particularly keen to study at the University of Salford because they meet my criteria. Firstly, their methodology of teaching includes 50% of practical projects and 50% examination which will prepare students for real life problem-solving skills as a data scientist. Secondly, the course modules include data analytics, data mining, advanced database which I find invaluable to my career development as a data scientist. Lastly, the school has a long-standing and existing relationship with Nigerian students to the extent of having an office in Lagos, Nigeria. With data science in the oil and gas industry, recent research shows that data gathered from drilling can be applied to conduct various analyses from scheduling to drilling operations thereby improving drilling performance. Also, in production engineering, big data analytics can optimize the performance of production pumps while it can also manage risks and enhance safety by improving oil and gas occupational safety. From my experience as a data entry officer, studying data science at the University of Salford will provide me the technical skills needed to predict and guide the nation\\'s oil and gas sector into the future of the industry, if given the chance. The future of oil and gas industry lies with data science and I believe with the right minds, we can move the nation forward. In terms of national development, data science can help predict and utilize the majority of the natural gas which is being flared off subsequently enhancing the output of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) for the masses. Also, with its predictions, oil production capacity can be optimized, improving the export capacity of the nation as well as increasing the government revenue. Applying advanced analytics and artificial intelligence provides oil and gas industry the ability to identify trends and predict events throughout processes which will enable quick response to disruption and improve efficiencies. From PTDF objectives, this scholarship would boost my career development and as the saying goes, \"data is just like crude; it is valuable, but if unrefined it cannot be put to good use\". I aim to impact the Nigerian Oil and Gas industry through data science in whatever capacity I can when I get back from my postgraduate studies. On this note, I look forward to a successful application and commencing my academic career at the University of Salford as a PTDF scholar.'),\n",

Works cited\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nA handshake is a traditional symbol that has been used to signify different things. There are different kinds of handshakes that are used in different situations and for different age groups. Mostly a handshake is used to show the kind of relationship that one has towards the other and the desire for them to participate in communication or a deal that is being made. A handshake is also a term that is used to refer to a reward that one is granted for work well done. It may be in form of monetary value or simply a token. A handshake may also be used to signify the desire for a relationship as it brings two parties together (Akers, 24).\\n\\nThere are different angles that the palm or the wrist is supposed to be directed to show the person who is greater than the other either by authority or age. A handshake is usually accompanied by an eye contact to signify how sincere the party is. There are however different meanings that are attached to the handshake basing on different communities.\\n\\nWestern culture\\n\\nIn western culture, a handshake is mostly used when making business deals. It is however applied when an agreement has been made towards a deal and acts as a sign that the parties involved will work together. For instance, when different leaders come together to make certain agreements, they will first discuss them and there after required to sign the agreements (Jennings, 80). After both signatures have been received, they are required to shake hands to signify that they are of one mind. This is also done for business people that have agreed on certain contracts. A handshake may also be used in western culture to welcome a stranger. This is usually done to make them feel comfortable and as a form of assurance that they will be treated well.\\n\\nAfrican culture\\n\\nIn the African culture, a handshake is used as a form of respect to the elders. The younger people are usually expected to shake the hands of their elders while touching their elbow to show how much they respect them. As they extend the handshake, they are not required to maintain an eye contact with them as it signifies lack of humility. If the authority being referred to is very high, the handshake is supposed to be accompanied by a bended knee. It is the younger or junior person that is required to extend the handshake first (Akers, 18). The handshake may be accepted or denied depending on how it has been extended or the attitude that the elder has towards the junior party. People of the same age group and status will use a normal handshake or that which they prefer.\\n\\nAsian culture\\n\\nIn Asia, a handshake is usually used as a form of religious worship. There are words that may be said by the person extending the handshake to signify their authority. The elder people or those that are in spiritual position will use it to bless other people. They will handshake them as they chant certain words that are meant to inspire them. Unlike the African culture, it is the older party that is supposed to extend the greeting to a younger party (Jennings, 145).\\n\\nThey will hence choose whom to give the handshake and whom to deny. There are certain categories of people that are not exchange greetings in a handshake, they may either wave or simply fold their hands on their chest to extend the greetings. This is done to signify to the other individual that the authority they hold does not allow them to give a handshake. It is a form of showing humility and respect.\\n\\nWorks cited\\n\\nAkers, Susie.

They were buzzing with excitement because today was the day. They were going to get the glasses they needed and deserved. People of all ages were there. Mothers brought their young children and men helped their elderly parents find a chair while they waited in line. The crowd was sorted by sending them to one of three places after an initial eye test. The first was home because they were lucky and had good eyes. The second was to the autorefractor and prescription lens room. The third was to the reading room, where I was stationed. Working in the reading room I saw the power of a pair of glasses. It was impossible to miss. Seeing people's faces as they read the tiny print in their beloved bible, or as they threaded a needle without the help of someone with younger eyes was miraculous. As they read or threaded, their smiles would grow until their whole face was beaming. Their faces gleamed with pride as they showed their friends or family their new glasses. I didn't see one person walk out the door without a grin on their face. Thinking about it still makes me smile. I had never thought about how easy it was to get glasses until I met people who didn't have that opportunity. A simple trip to the optometrist's office and a week or two wait until they arrived is hardly a chore. During the two weeks I spent in Nicaragua, I learned that it is really a luxury we often overlook. I met people there who had never seen a doctor, let alone an eye doctor. When they received their glasses they were unquestionably grateful. It was a beautiful thing, and seeing it has helped me become more grateful for the wonderful opportunities I have and the simple things, like eyeglasses, that I had overlooked. Any revisions, comments or ideas would be greatly appreciated! Thank You.\"),\n",

I have spent my life focused on bettering myself as a person while also playing a major role in my family. In order for me to stay focused on school while working full-time, emotionally and financially assisting my family and more importantly, myself, I have had to adapt to a higher level of maturity not commonly found within people my age. As a daughter I have helped my father communicate with others due to a disability from a stroke while also helping my mother with the bills and raising my younger adolescent sister. I grew up a bit faster compared to my peers because of these family circumstances which I have no shame in whatsoever. Aside from my familial responsibilities I also have responsibilities to myself. I dedicate about thirty-five to forty hours a week at Nordstrom as a sales associate working solely on commission while also remaining focused on my studies. In the beginning it took a lot of adjusting to attain such a well-balanced life and I must admit it was a struggle working full-time while also being a full-time student. I have learned to find a balance between work and school and also between my family and myself as an individual. Leading a well-balanced life has helped me build character. Growing up I never would have thought my life would turn out the way it has because of my father's stroke. Although traumatic events can cause pain, they can also bring forth new beginnings and strength. I have gained infinite amounts of lessons because I have always tried to conquer all the challenges' life has faced me with. Whether these challenges are from within or with the outer world, I have dealt with them as good as I can with no regrets, but with hopes for a better future. My focus has been to make the best of my life, which for me is working to support myself, furthering my education, being the best daughter and sister I can be, and gradually building on a better me. Upholding such a strong role in my family and having to be dependent on my own income along with my reliance on financial aid has been of utmost priority to me, which may explain my lack of participation in extracurricular activities in college. As much as I would have loved to dedicate myself to activities I enjoyed in high school such as choir and student government, I had to accept the fact that I have different circumstances. Despite this fact I would prefer to believe that I have attempted to excel in all areas of my life and hope to continue to do so through continuing my education. My maturity has helped me develop a strong sense of self-identity along with a balance of the more important matters in my life-family, education and finding my place in the world.\"),\n",

When I started high school about three years ago it did not take me long to realize that the next four years were going to be a challenge. I knew that I had to accept the challenge of balancing honor academic classes and my plethora of extracurricular activities. I especially learned how to balance my school work and put my cheerleading skills to use for a good cause. The word, \"Virus\" signifies strength, might, power, and influence. As a student I have shown intellectual strength by taking classes that will give me a better sense of college course work. I take classes that are harder than some common classes taken at my school. Although these classes could be difficult I always try my best to be successful. I have always been a student that likes to challenge myself on a regular basis. This has taught me the importance of staying strong through difficult times because not everything is going to be easy. Also, as a strong-willed student I have achieved something that has always been a dream of mine. From the start of fifth grade, I wanted to have perfect attendance up until the day of my high school graduation. This dream has been fulfilled as of this point, and I intend to continue this exceptional record until the end of the year and through my many years of college. This aspect of my life shows my physical strength. I have to keep my body and mind healthy, so I can attend school every day to learn as much as possible. These strengths allow me to overcome weaknesses, so I can achieve my best. The word, \"Arts\" refers to the beauty within a skill, craft, or art. Throughout my early years, I was a cheerleader up until eighth grade. My love for cheerleading seemed to come to an end when I did not make my high school cheerleading squad. Luckily cheerleading never completely exited my life because I was able to pass on my skills to young girls that were aspiring to be cheerleaders. I started to coach a local youth cheerleading squad in eighth grade, and I have continued this work into my senior year. I was a leader to these girls by teaching them basic moves, sideline cheers, and halftime routines. These girls went on to win multiple competitions within the past three seasons. I hope that my cheerleading skills that I have passed onto these girls will allow them to achieve their goals. I hope that my experience shows them that even when something might seem like it has ended there is always an alternative. These experiences and accomplishments have opened my eyes to my many strengths and skills. These strengths will help me to achieve great things as a student at Florida State University.

However, the first incidence of crisis occurs in the life of the couple with the financial and material demands of Wang뗩 uncle and Wang뗩 obsession to own more property and the drought that results in a bad harvest. O-lan manages crisis and in an attempt to save her newborn child from starvation she strangles the baby to death. At the end of the novel, Wang is an unhappy man due to the conduct of his two elder sons who are awaiting his death to sell their father뗩 hard-earned property. Even at the time of death, Wang is able to find fulfillment only when he returns to the kind of life he lived as a peasant irrespective of his huge property.\\n\\nLikewise, Nectar in a sieve is a story about the poverty-stricken family of Ruku and Nathan. Though they manage to earn a good living, heavy rain spoils the crop. The crisis in the family looms large with the return of their married daughter and the loss of Ruku뗩 two sons who worked at the tannery. The family is set to move out of their village in search of a better livelihood. Their life in the new place is also a misery with the onset of drought. While Wang뗩 uncle plays a wicked plan to extort food and money in The Good Earth, it is Kunti, the ex-beloved of Nathan who plays the wicked role to extract money from both Nathan and Ruku.\\n\\nNathan and Ruku later return to their home village only to witness another death, the death of their younger son. Since the family was unable to make their ends meet the daughter takes to prostitution to feed her starving younger brother.\\n\\nThe concept of crisis, death, and giving in Lord of the flies is portrayed by the boys who are estranged on the island with no way to communicate with the mainland to save them. Therefore a leader is chosen to deal with the crisis. However, there is a disagreement about the leadership and results in two groups. The newly elected leader is over ambitious and wishes to overthrow the first leader and in the run, several boys are killed. Though the first leader portrayed by Ralph is a protagonist and a reasonable person, the antagonist spoils his plan to attract passing ships to rescue them. The protagonist delegates job among the boys to do the role of firekeepers and all of them give in to it in the hope of escaping from the island.\\n\\nIn The Good Earth and Nectar in a Sieve, people rise to the occasion to manage crises and protect their families from starvation. The Lord of flies, however, narrates the crisis of a group of boys who are first left alone on the island and are later battling an internal clash that can be related to a tribal act.\\n\\nThe plot of all three novels revolves around crisis, death, and giving. It may be concluded that the human life cycle is a mixture of these three factors which arise in various living settings like family or a group of people. The novels also indicate that there is a solution for all and finally man has to die a satisfactory or unsatisfactory death though one can establish several achievements in life.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nBuck, Pearl.

Also is it okay if it is 587 words but less than 6000 characters? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -Ever since I was a kid, I have always wanted to grow up and become a billionaire. I thought that money can get you anything, even happiness, and that money is really what makes the world go round. This view of mine was altered, however, after reading the novella \"The Pearl\" by John Steinbeck in my freshmen year in high school. The novella revolves around a man name King who finds a pearl of great wealth that ultimately causes him nothing but trouble due to the greed that consumed him. He initially sets out to find the pearl in order to cure his sick son, and he is succeeds in doing so by finding a huge pearl of great value. The pearl comes to represent not only the money needed to pay for his son\\'s treatment, but it also represents King\\'s hopes and dreams for his family. The pearl aids King in becoming a big shot in his village where he is envied for his great success. At first, King\\'s accomplishment and fortunate luck had only intensified my desire to obtain a colossal amount of wealth, but the story then took a twisted turn. King began to become consumed by greed, and he refused to sell the pearl for the large sum of money offered because he desired more. The pearl, that once represented King\\'s hopes turned into an object of moral destruction that changed King from a loving father to a savage man who is blind to everything but wealth. The horrific consequences that followed show that greed leads to nothing but trouble. The pearl causes King to murder a man and savagely beat his wife. Also, it ultimately leads to the death of his child. These consequences are truly appalling, and after reading this book I hope that I don\\'t follow the same path as King. This novella has affected me in a number of ways and has changed the way I see the world. Before reading this book, I truly thought that money is the only thing that matters in this world and without it happiness can\\'t exist. My assumption turned out wrong, however, because after reading this book I learned that making money is not what is most important. What really counts is how I obtain the money and how I use is in order to help my family. This is what King originally had in mind, but he loses sight of his dreams and hopes when greed starts to consume him and fails in achieving his original goal. Another way this book has affected me, is that it showed me that family should be my top priority. King\\'s wife tries to get rid of the pearl due to the danger it was causing the family, but King stops her attempt and savagely beats her for trying to get rid of the pearl. The result was the horrible experiences that he and his family suffered, and this shows that it is wise to always put family first. Lastly this book made me consider the many options and opportunities I have ion life. I originally planned to pursue a career that got me the most money, but after reading this book I started to consider a profession that I am interested in. This will lead me to a life of true happiness compared to a life where I would be a slave to the dollar.'),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Family Violence in History and Nowadays Essay\\n\\nInterests in learning about family violence\\n\\nI am interested in family violence because I want to be a police officer. Daily through the media, we are bombarded with information in relation to family violence in its different forms. I am interested in learning more about family violence due to the desire to understand the factors that contribute to high cases of domestic violence. I think the information in this course will be important in helping me to understand the various issues with regard to domestic violence. Examples of family violence are sexual harassment and rape, psychological assault perpetrated by both men and women. It has been shown that cultures of different communities support many types of violent acts (Majau, 2014).\\n\\nHow history has contributed to violence in the family today\\n\\nThe patriarchal power system is not embodied in the biological males, but it is a social construction (Gosselin, 2014).Therefore, the long history of male domination is insightful in determining whether this cultural subordination of women to men provides the reason for the existence of the inequalities that exist between the sexes and also establishes the effect of globalization of this topic.\\n\\nThe information is necessitated by the fact that this family violence is usually not reported, or even when reported, the perpetrators go scot-free (Majau, 2014). There are fewer legislation and policies to curb family violent acts (Gosselin, 2014). The other inherent aspect of this topic is how this culture has been interred in the women that they are not only the perennial victims, but they are also perpetrators of this vice by silently hiding their sufferings or by psychologically taunting other women.\\n\\nThus, family violence can largely be attributed to the underrepresentation of women at home and other major decision-making institutions such as religious institutions and learning institutions (Majau, 2014). This becomes a barrier for women to attain power and change the oppressive traditions. In fact, efforts have to be focused on empowering women in different communities.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nGosselin, D. K. (2014).

       " Document(page_content='Dear Principal,\\n\\nAs a student, of course, I would not agree with the \"no cell phone policy.\" Students are always on there phone\\'s, and quite recently, there have been several incidents regarding a cell phone. examples like: texting in class, the phones going off in class and being a disruption. I do understand your concern for a change. IF you do allow policy 1 (allow the students to bring the phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.) I believe there should be some modifications involved.\\n\\nI am in agreement to both policies, but I am more along the lines of policy one. Policy one is stating that the use of cell phones are okay to be using in school to a minimum. I am concerned that students would take advantage of this offer, so minor consequences should be involved, example: referral. Another concern I have is if the students forget or do not have time to turn off and back on there cell phones between passing periods. I am not concerned about the lunch period however, you have about thirty minutes to make sure your cell phone is turned OFF before entering a classroom.\\n\\nTechnology is at it\\'s greatest in this century, there is practically every device you could think of. Including a device that will ruin reception in the classroom. If the student\\'s phone is not turned off before entering the classroom, it would be no use to use, the device would cut all reception. I do believe this should be placed in every classroom. This will cut all worries of your phone going off in class or a disruption from a text.\\n\\nAlthough it may lower all those causes, it will also lower the amount of referrals being given out to the students who do chose to text in class and get caught. As for the students who do have there phone\\'s out and get caught with them, a referral should be given.\\n\\nI do not think phone\\'s should be allowed during passing periods. You will have at least five minutes to turn your phone on, send a text or two, and turn it back on, and still be on time to class. I think it will cut into passing time. You will see a trend of students being late to there class because they are caught up in sending a text rather than being focused to get to class on time.\\n\\nWith a few perfecting modifications, I do in fact believe this policy will be do-able. I am in full agreement with the policy, with the changes applied. Phones should be located on the student incase of any emergency, they will be able to contact parent/guardian or 911. Regardless, I do NOT agree with policy 2 in ANY way.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME            '),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The Bush tax cuts lowered the federal tax rate for income for all income ranges. People that earned more (and therefore had a higher tax rate) had a bigger cut to their taxes percentage wise. Politicians generally don\\'t like to do things permanently (in case there are unforeseen circumstances, or so they can use the same issue to score points with the voters), so they were set to expire after Bush would leave office. The good part was that people had lower taxes. The bad part was we didn\\'t cut our spending when we cut the taxes, so the government borrowed a ton of money to cover that spending. The pro of extending them is that people will keep more of their paycheck, and politicians will get to say \"we didn\\'t raise your taxes.\" The con is we will either continue borrowing money or have to cut some services from the government. Cutting government services almost always means some government workers lose their jobs and people that depend on those services have a harder time of it. There\\'s a controversial idea that, depending on who you believe, is either a pro or con. There\\'s something called the Laffer Curve, which basically says \"If tax rate is 0, tax revenue will be zero, but if tax rate is 100, tax revenue will still be zero because nobody will work if they just lose all their money to taxes. Somewhere between these is a percentage that give you maximum tax revenue.\" A simple idea, but with two issues. One, some people argue that a tax rate of 100 just means the government provides you everything you need, so people would still work (this is called communism - hasn\\'t worked out so well in practice). The other issue is that nobody knows for sure what percentage that maximum point is. Conservatives think we are to the right of the peak, so lowering taxes means more people will workinvest, and income will go up. So extending the tax break means people keep investingworking. Liberals think we are to the left of the curve, where raising the tax rate just means we get more tax revenue to pay for things, and people will keep workinginvesting at nearly the same rate. History seems to indicate the Liberals are right about the curve (some economists think the peak is at 65), but nobody knows for sure and it\\'s hard to test.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"I enjoy photography as a hobby. However, I have a friend who is a professional and when he shows me the new shots he's taken, I can't help but think that I could do the same thing, given the appropriate time and money. Let me address my two points in the title: 1. Being at the right place at the right time: My friend recently came back from a trip to Yellowstone and Had some really stunning pictures. However, in a place like Yellowstone, the pictures really take themselves. Take another example - National Geographic. If you're job was to go to a remote village most people have never seen and take a picture of people in culture quite different than the rest of the world, even a poorly taken photo will be captivating. Even more so when combined with the next point: 2. The right gear: Certainly, I understand that good gear doesn't make good pictures by itself. However, they do make them go from good to great in a lot of cases, all else being equal. There is a noticeable difference between a kit lens and a professional lens (otherwise people wouldn't she'll out several thousand dollars for them). All that being said, I do acknowledge that there is a certain amount of creative freedom in the taking of the picture (angles, rule of thirds, etc). However, I believe those are smaller factors in the greatness of a picture. The other two items I mentioned take no skill, per se, but affect the picture greatly. A great subject framed poorly will always trump a poor subject framed greatly. However, I want to believe photography is actual art form and not a matter of travel and money.

       " Document(page_content='The Secret Life of Walter Mitty by James Thurber Essay\\n\\nThe short story by James Thurber provides a distinct idea on the significance of leadership in the family. However, it is not explained by merely positive coloring, but through the battlefield of family life. Starting with the title of the book, one can simply perceive the gist of the whole story. It is no wonder that Walter Mitty is out of his normal way of life. He is reduced to what everyone calls 랇ife, meaning the charms of family reality.\\n\\nHowever, the tragedy of Mitty is in the fact that he encounters misunderstanding and gross indifference on the part of his wife. The way the story is narrated provides a cross-relational discourse between Mitty뗩 inner world of dreaming and the real essence of dying from enduring the tension from his wife. Here comes the more social character of the story as opposed to its moral side. Walter Mitty is a victim of female pretenses concerning life prospects in the marital reality.\\n\\nThey say that Mitty is weak in his moral background, for he cannot explain to his wife the way things go around him. He even dares not to do so, for taking over his wife, he could face a new obstacle in relationships. It is a point at which the female and male parties are contradicting each other following personal intentions. She claims with a sort of condemnation: Remember to get those overshoes while I뗤 having my hair done (Thumber 8).\\n\\nThis decisive moment in the story proves the assumption that women are not powerless in their relationships with men. It constitutes their forceful influence beyond physical reality but by moral provocations or just ignorance. However, Walter Mitty has found a better way to step back from the constant outside pressure on him. He dares disengage himself from the harmful effect going from his spouse. Dreams serve to be a so-called shelter for Walter뗩 sensitive, though steadfast, soul.\\n\\nThe excerpt in the book when he shouts about the fact that it is natural for him to be thinking invigorates the gist of the whole story. Engaging in fantasy is the case of Walter뗩 triumph over his misery in life (Mathews 28). He is sick and tired to suffer from such a monotonous life full of notations of his wife. He claims more personal freedom by letting himself know that his wife뗩 instructions do not apply to him. That is the way that encompasses the tragic estimation of Walter뗩 life. He is solely involved in the process of fantasizing and dreaming through and through. Hence, he gets no sense in shaping the reality in which he lives.\\n\\nI was thinking, said Walter Mitty. Does it ever occur to you that I am sometimes thinking (Thurber 17)? This is the point that characterizes Walter as manly enough to refute the claim of his spouse to put overshoes on. To be precise, Walter cannot keep up with the essence of so controversial happiness he has at the time. His genius as well as his preferences and ability to feel are not taken into account by a person allegedly created to address such a calling of the heart.\\n\\nTo sum up, Walter Mitty is a victim of female authority. He has nothing to do with it, but he does not give up by dreaming and reaching out the reality he wants to shape in his life.\\n\\nWorks cited\\n\\nMathews, Richard.

And teachers making them would mean a lesser chance of cheating\\n\\nIf students were to design summer projects for themselves then they wouldn't be remembering as much if teachers design it because students would just make the work really easy so they wouldn't have to do much. Also if students made them then there would be a higher chance of the students cheating because a student could make something that is very similar to another students work and the teacher wouldn't even know. And the students could have just thought of the same idea and then they turn it in and the teacher thinks they cheated when it was just a coincidence so they get in trouble for thinking similarly.\\n\\nIf teachers designed them then it would be less work on the students and the teacher and the teachers already make work for the students. the way it would be less work for the students is they wouldn't have to think about what they're going to make they would just have to think about how they are going to do it. And teachers would have less work because they would know a general idea of what they were grading instead of it being something the student made up. Also teachers already make work for the students so they are used to it. And if teachers made them there would be less chances of cheating because the teacher made the work so she would know if the students were copying from each other\\n\\nThose are some reasons why teachers should make the summer projects instead of the student.

A student life advisor at my school said community service is, \"Building your moral character and expanding your spiritual self.\" Northwestern students are dedicated to civic engagement, each student dedicated to a certain cause. At Northwestern, I would like to get involved working with Autistic children or the Special Olympics like other students in the past. I would also participate in the Freshmen Urban Program at Northwestern because it will introduce me to new students who also interested in community service. My studies will lead me towards a career, but the community service will help me grow into a better person. Student life is just as influential for growth as academics or civic engagement. Every student at Northwestern has ample opportunities to experience student life. I wouldn\\'t feel left out if I didn\\'t go Greek because there are so many other resident halls where students with similar interests go. The campus wide events that bring all students together as a community aid our growth as a whole. I am enthusiastic about learning and growing with this diverse student body. The new friendships and adventures I\\'ll have at Northwestern will forever shape my life. The conclusion is sweet and simple. This decision wasn\\'t difficult at all. Northwestern is where I want to start this new adventure, exploring my intellect and growing into an adult.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Using the following quotation from \"The Moral Obligations of Living in a Democratic Society\" as a starting point, tell us about an event or experience that helped you define one of your values or changed how you approach the world: \"Empathy is not simply a matter of trying to imagine what others are going through, but having the will to muster enough courage to do something about it. In a way, empathy is predicated upon hope.\" - Corner West, Class of 1943 University Professor in the Center for African American Studies, Princeton University \"Have the courage to say no. Have the courage to face the truth. Do the right thing because it is right. These are the magic keys to living your life with integrity.\" I once stumbled upon this quote while surfing the web, and it has been a constant reminder of how to approach issues of morality. Ethical dilemmas, more often than not, are character-defining moments, and it is in these moments that we can learn about ourselves, and grow from the experience. When I was in middle school, I faced a decisive ethical dilemma. I was in class with one of my best friends, Sawyer, when a classmate came up, made fun of his appearance, and said something along the lines of \"go to hell.\" There was no mistake about it; he was deliberately trying to hurt his feelings, and for no conceivable reason at that. There I was, witnessing an entirely unwarranted assault, and I knew that I had to do something about it. At that moment, something inside me was telling me to stand up for my friend. I knew that a great injustice had been done to him; I knew that it was wrong, and I knew that he didn\\'t deserve it. Even so, the worst part of the entire situation, was that I did nothing. Instead of doing what I knew was right, I internalized that feeling and failed to act. Not only did I fail my friend, but I also failed myself. \"There is no such thing as a minor lapse in integrity\"; looking back, few words have ever shaken me so profoundly. I still feel guilty of not acting-I was the bystander that watches something unjust, and I did nothing about it. It occurred to me that I, his best friend, didn\\'t stand up for him, and it was at that moment that I took a good, hard look at my character. I then resolved to never let something like that happen again; I resolved to never be the bystander that watches and does nothing. When I witness the state of the humanity, I always think to myself, \"things can be better. Things should be better.\" However, change and growth starts at the individual, and it is in experiences like my own that we learn to \"Be the change you want to see in the world.\" Empathy, means \"having the will to muster enough courage to do something.\" Questions of ethics, honesty, and integrity can be intensely challenging, and it is in these trials that we affirm and develop in our integrity. I matured from my experience, and I have lived with the growth, the memory, and the regret, ever since.')]"

From the Age of Change chapter, the following facts could be obtained:\\n\\n  * Bolivar뗩 revolutionary campaign inspired the past century뗩 events, including the American independence and French and Haitian revolutions. Bolivar was motivated mainly by the Haitian revolution; however, the American scenario seemed more attractive (278).\\n  * During La Guair치뗩 rebel conspirators distributed the French-inspired title The Rights of Man and Citizen to support revolutionary plans (280).\\n  * The elites of Vila Rica, pressed by the royal tax demand, decided to follow the idea of the Enlightenment and the American Revolution. Twelve prominent citizens created the plan to kill the royal governor forming an independent U.S.-style republic (280).\\n  * Bahian rebel was the one that required independence from Portugal, highlighting the importance of free trade and freedom of religion, as well as aristocratic designation and total abolishment of slavery (281).\\n  * Hidalgo, a leader of the Mexican revolution, was captured and found guilty for his views after the Guadalajara conflict (282).\\n  * The chain of independence referred to the cycle of events in the 1810s when the countries of Central America started to declare their status. In 1822 the unity between Spanish South American countries seemed possible, as Bolivar extended his authority in Peru (283).\\n  * The first resultative campaign on the way to independence of Spanish South America emerged in the Rio de la Plata region, where local leaders created Buenos Aires after defeating 라 rogue British force (286).\\n  * The freedom of Venezuela was mainly facilitated by two persons, Francisco de Miranda and Simon Bolivar.

Differences between Regenerative and Net-Change MRP Systems\\n 3. Benefits and Limitations of MRP as a Push-System\\n 4. Reference\\n\\nMaterial Requirement Planning System뗩 Inputs and Outputs\\n\\nMaterial requirements planning is the system for turning master schedule requirements for end items into time-phased requirements for subassemblies, components, and raw materials. Inputs and outputs are affecting the MRP and its efficiency. The inputs required to build a system are a master schedule formed by orders and forecasts, design changes plan process with a bill of materials, and inventory records containing receipts and withdrawals (Stevenson, 2014). When MRP is set up and used, several outcomes appear, and they can be divided into primary and secondary reports and an inventory transaction. Primary outputs are changes, order releases, and planned-order schedules, and the secondary ones are the exception, planning, and performance-control reports (Stevenson, 2014). The proper translation of master requirements can help successfully manage the order and appliance of assemblies and raw materials.\\n\\nDifferences between Regenerative and Net-Change MRP Systems\\n\\nMPR can be updated via the two most useful systems: regenerative and net-change approaches. The main difference between these practices is that the regenerative system edits MRP뗩 data periodically, while the net-change one does it continuously (Stevenson, 2014). The regenerative method is based on picking an interval and complying with the changes in all aspects to discover what MPR뗩 updates to make (Stevenson, 2014). The net-change approach modifies a system after every requirement of change on a continuous basis (Stevenson, 2014). The regenerative system is the most suitable for managing stable MRPs, while the net-change method can deal with the inconsistent ones.\\n\\nBenefits and Limitations of MRP as a Push-System\\n\\nMRP is a push system that helps determine the costs, quantities, and availability requirements in a time-based manner so that the results can be forecasted and then achieved. This operation method뗩 benefits are low demand for in-process updates, the ability to manage material and capacity requirements, the allocation of production time, and the potential to determine the inventory usage (Stevenson, 2014). MRP implementation뗩 main limitation is the necessity to have a computer with the software capable of handling calculations and maintaining records. Moreover, the system can only be applied if accurate and approved master schedules, bills, and inventory records are properly collected (Stevenson, 2014). Any inexact piece of data can lead the companies to significant order, production, and delivery issues.\\n\\nReference\\n\\nStevenson, W. (2014). Operations Management. (12th ed.).

       " Document(page_content='Zora Neale Hurston, Her Biography and Works Essay\\n\\nThe twentieth century was marked by the appearance of prominent figures in African American literature. In this regard, Zora Neale Hurston was one of the most extraordinary and versatile persons concerned about acute racial issues in the United States. She was memorized due to her sympathy for Black workers and women who continuously experienced racial discrimination in the South. Thus, this paper aims at providing a summary of readings about Zora Hurston뗩 life, indicating her most outstanding works, central themes, and important moments of life.\\n\\nThe birth of Zora Hurston was slightly mysterious and obscure, and even its date was first established wrongly by the researchers of her biography. In particular, 랍cholars set the year of her birth as 1901, as in fact, she was born a decade earlier, on January 7, 1891 in Notasulga, Alabama (Zora Neale Hurston 997). When Hurston was a toddler, her family moved to Eatonville, Florida, her hometown that acquired a mythic image in her writings (ㄹbout Zora Neale Hurston). In Eatonville, Hurston뗩 family flourished, and her father even became one of the town뗩 mayors. Nevertheless, at that period, Hurston faced her first hardships, such as the death of her mother, clashes with her step-mother, and problems with studies. Despite all those events, Hurston 란arned her high school diploma from Morgan Academy in 1918, then studied sporadically at Howard University (Zora Neale Hurston 997). Hence, she obtained profound education, which was rare for Black women at that time.\\n\\nIn New York, in 1925, Zora Hurston revealed the talent of an artist and considerably contributed to the Harlem Renaissance. At Columbia, owing to the support of Franz Boas, a distinguished figure in anthropology, she was engrossed in examining black folklore and then published Mules and Men , the first collection of African American folktales. Hurston뗩 most outstanding works include Jonah뗩 Gourd Vine (1934), Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937), Moses, Man of the Mountain (1939), Seraph on the Suwanee (1948) (Norwood). For instance, her first novel 랃ad been well received both by the critics and the public (Zora Neale Hurston 998). The second work demonstrated the characters victory over limitations inflicted by poverty and discrimination. Overall, Zora Hurston continues to influences many writers throughout the world, forever having cemented her niche in history as an eminent writer of the twentieth century.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nㄹbout Zora Neale Hurston.

       " Document(page_content='Cultural Influences on Family Values and Habits Essay\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n 1. Introduction\\n 2. Attitude to Communication with Children\\n 3. External Factors\\n 4. Conclusion\\n 5. Works Cited\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThe formation of cultural competence and basic habits of behavior is largely due to the background of people and their established way of life. Many forms of communication, interaction, and approaches to work are the reflection of those skills and abilities that were obtained in the past and serve as the source of existing experience. The cultural influence of the family is perhaps the most significant factor determining personal life transitions and attitudes to different everyday aspects. Copying can be unconscious; nevertheless, these are basic habits that largely determine the character of the person뗩 future way of life. Therefore, one of the primary sources of cultural influence is family traditions and values \\u200b\\u200blaid down in childhood.\\n\\nAttitude to Communication with Children\\n\\nHaving a close relationship with relatives, a person often adopts the manner of behavior of their loved ones. Perhaps, therefore, Chan claims that the fate of one family member can be influenced by the behavior of the other if there is a close relationship between them (71). The tradition of spending time with children, celebrating holidays in a close circle, pleasing one another with gifts  all these habits, as a rule, remain with people in adulthood.\\n\\nThe US way of life largely determines the peculiarities of upbringing. Walking to the beach in summer and to the pool in winter is a typical American pastime. However, even following some of the local trends, it is possible to preserve native traditions, regularly maintaining the customs of the family and incorporating them into the US culture. Very often, children do not need to be aware of the worries of adulthood, and all they need is to understand that they are taken care of and are supported by their parents (Accawi 88). Thus, attitudes toward loved ones can be learned from experiences that parents have.\\n\\nExternal Factors\\n\\nIn addition to family values \\u200b\\u200band habits, some external factors can have a significant impact on people뗩 cultural preferences. As an example, the idea of \\u200b\\u200bSchildkrout can be taken who notes that the tradition to decorate the body in various ways has a global trend, and this practice has been adopted for many centuries (79). Also, the circle of communication is one of the crucial factors influencing cultural preferences of people. As Grande remarks, some acquaintances and friends who have a strong impact on a person form persistent preferences concerning certain life phenomena, which can also take a beginning in childhood (95). Therefore, external factors are no less important than family traditions and the type of upbringing.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThus, cultural background is, in fact, the reflection of the human experience and preferences and is formed due to established habits that have their roots in the past. Family traditions and values play an essential role in the process of developing an individual culture and preferences regarding specific situations. In addition to behavioral patterns that are adopted from childhood, the circle of communication is of great importance in the process of personality development and the formation of cultural interests.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nAccawi, Anwar F.

       " Document(page_content='The Antioxidant Properties of Peptides Essay (Article)\\n\\nThe synthesis of the most active fragments of peptides is possible when identifying the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC-FL) of component amino acids in these parts of peptides. Thus, the highest value of oxygen radical absorbance capacity was determined for Trp, and high ORAC-FL values were identified for Tyr and Met. This aspect indicates the significant and rather high antioxidant activity of these amino acids.\\n\\nThe lower antioxidant activity was typical of Cys, His, and Phe. Other amino acids, including Arg, Asn, Gln, and Asp among them, did not demonstrate any antioxidant activity. The explanation of the activity for Trp and Tyr is based on the ability of the indolic and phenolic groups to perform as hydrogen donors. As a result, stable indoyl and phenoxyl radicals become formed. In its turn, Met is oxidised, but Cys provides the sulfur hydrogen. Thus, the radical scavenging activity, in this case, is explained by the presence of Trp, Tyr, Met, and His in peptides.\\n\\nThe synthesis process and the focus on radical scavenging activity for three sequences of active peptides indicated that the sequence Trp-Tyr-Ser- Leu-Ala-Met-Ala-Ala-Ser-Asp-Ile had high antioxidant activity. The radical scavenging activity was about 1.7- and 4-fold lower than it is of the flavonoid quercetin and p -coumaric acid, but antioxidant activity was higher than the activity of butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), which is a synthetic antioxidant with adverse effects.\\n\\nConsequently, BHA is proposed to be replaced with natural antioxidants. In order to improve food antioxidant properties and prevent the oxidation reaction, such natural antioxidants as hydrolysates from whey proteins can be utilised, and they can be obtained from cheese whey, for example. Comparing protein hydrolysates to antioxidants from plants, it is important to accentuate their extra nutritional value, but their antigenicity should also be considered before using them in food.\\n\\nThe capacity of this sequence is explained by the presence of Trp, Tyr, and Met. It is important to note that the antioxidant activity of amino acids can be weakened because of the peptidic bond and structural peptide conformation, and radical scavenging activity can be decreased when several amino acids are present because of antagonist effects.\\n\\nOther two sequences also indicated the radical scavenging activity because of the presence of Met and Tyr, but the antioxidant activity of these amino acids was even higher when they were measured separately. Moreover, the antioxidant activity of these amino acids was improved because of the peptidic bond and structural peptide conformation in contrast to the analysis of the previous sequence. Thus, both synergistic and antagonistic effects can be observed when several amino acids are present, influencing the radical scavenging activity.\\n\\nThe authors of the article conclude that this study is the first one to discuss the antioxidant properties of peptides that are taken from whey proteins with the help of enzymatic hydrolysis. In order to obtain antioxidant hydrolysates, Corolase PP is suitable to be used.\\n\\nThe tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) was used to identify 42 peptides. Among them, the focus of the authors was on the peptide Trp-Tyr-Ser- Leu-Ala-Met-Ala-Ala-Ser-Asp-Ile because of its high antioxidant activity that was greater than the capacity of BHA. Furthermore, the researchers accentuated specific synergistic and antagonistic effects on the antioxidant activity that resulted from the peptide conformation of the amino acids. Therefore, further research is required in order to examine these effects in detail with the focus on the antioxidant activity.\\n', metadata={'_id': '7fbedf488e3d4b0ea76577923d5f440b', '_collection_name': 'my_documents'}),\n",

These artifacts provide evidence of capacities I have developed during my studies.\\n\\nFirst, I would like to compare between OCD PART 2 BISMCS 234 Media & Communication Technique and Is This Chair Taken? B ARTS 151 Intro to Acting. Final Scene. The two videos I have made demonstrate my video production skills. Compare and contrast analysis of the two video projects demonstrate that in 춺OCD PART 2 BISMCS 234 Media & Communication Technique, I completed in 2016 shows my considerable progress in the video-production area as compared to the second video I have made in the year 2015.\\n\\nBeing specific, I need to mention that my progress is demonstrated by the following achievements: I have learned how to make cuts, insert background music, develop transitions, and choose the angle. I have also improved my sound recording skills as compared to the video made in 2015.\\n\\nAddressing my written project What Does Media and Communication Teach Us about Copyright and Fair Use?, I will need to focus on my writing skills development as well as my writing skills in English, specifically because English is my second language and, of course, I have to strive hard to achieve progress in this area. As for my writing skills in general, the paper demonstrates that I have mastered MLA citation style, have learned how to develop essay structure with its essential parts of the introduction, main body, and conclusion, transitions, and thesis statement positioning.\\n\\nIn addition, the written project 춺What Does Media and Communication Teach Us about Copyright and Fair Use? provided me with an opportunity to explore the topic that seems to be of great importance in the United States. I must confess that earlier, and I did not have an awareness of copyright and fair use matters in the media. However, the given project has provided me with a chance to fill this gap. Conducting my research and organizing my thoughts into a coherent and cohesive piece of writing, I have learned that current copyright laws have provided a considerable measure of protection for authors being in danger of copyrighting rights infringement due to abuse on the Internet. However, I have also found out that further improvements are needed because there are still many areas that lack regulations to control fair use matters.\\n\\nIn conclusion, assessment of the three chosen artifacts I have created during my studies has indicated that I have made considerable progress in the area of video production capabilities and writing art. I have also mastered the new skills of expressing my inner world with the use of video-making tools. In addition, I have improved my research skills to expand my world-vision and develop my intellectual plant.

Discussion sections for HIS, American History 1492-1864?? Just talking about history. Boring. Talking about the mind and why we think. Interesting. Ooh, good song now, Come Together. I wonder if there will be a keg tomorrow afternoon? It\\'s always nice coming back from class, taking a nap-a-roo, grabbing some grub, and filling\\' up a cup. I ordered a BMX bike tonight. Ok, from that pre-screening thing today that took way way longer that 1. 5 hours, but that\\'s probably because of my connection, it has been crappie\\' up all day, absolutely ridiculous, we live in an age where technical difficulties like these shouldn\\'t be. Anywho, yeah so mark me down for a little anxious and nervous about this recent BMX online purchase tonight. I got an email verification and all but when I typed in the tracking package number, nothing showed or came up, so. A little worried. Next song,  ;drum rolls please. Let It Be. Sears Tower? 24. 305? Strawberry? Crazy things went down today, cops on motorcycles, people slamming into the back of other cars, anti-freeze spraying all over the place, high speed chase, people being arrested, all before logic?!?!?! You know it\\'s sad but true. Next song, Eleanor Rigby. Good commercial, Corona Light, mmmmm. I should play golf sometime. I have one \"Pimp My Room\" upgrade point. I don\\'t really mind letting my fellow co-opers use my truck, just don\\'t mess up the trust, right? At least they lock the doors. Gas though? Other perks? Will it last all semester? All year? I find it interesting because I don\\'t know the answer to that. Last song, Revolution. Welp, the pop-up just told me my 20 minutes is up, so I\\'m out!

       " Document(page_content='Researching of Inequality Culture in Africa Essay\\n\\nBeing the second-largest continent globally with more than 50 independent countries, Africa is characterized by inequality in culture and differences in treatment. Despite multiple efforts to reduce inequality, this country experiences multiple challenges. African citizens face inequality due to an unequal distribution of opportunities, existing religious disparities, and the impact of gender factors.\\n\\nAfrica is known for its cultural diversity due to its distribution of opportunities that are never the same for all regions. The countries with similar geographical locations or access to natural resources, like C칪te d뗄voire, Nigeria, or Namibia, differ in their investors, which explains their cultural inequality. A variety of languages, exchange of experience, and history of tribes determine disparity at different levels.\\n\\nAnother example of how cultural inequality affects human lives in Africa is based on the existing religious disparities. There are more than 3000 tribes in the country that rely on their cosmology, the history of tribes, and the development of nations. Ideological problems, social values, and interpersonal relationships shape an understanding of cultural issues and make people prefer various stories and lifestyles in their everyday activities.\\n\\nGender diversity may also be the reason for cultural inequality in Africa. Although the population of this country is equally proportionate between males and females, women obtain fewer chances to stabilize their lives and deal with poverty. Women have less political power and support in many African countries, which leads to additional cultural impacts and social consequences.\\n\\nIn general, cultural inequality in Africa is a burning question due to the associated outcomes and influences. In addition to differences in gender roles and opportunities, religious beliefs define inequality and disturb populations. In my opinion, inequality culture is an integral element of the continent뗩 development, and its understanding is required to learn an African style of life.\\n', metadata={'_id': 'fbe8096bf6d741219773a6c2a559d0ac', '_collection_name': 'my_documents'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Status of Women and Free African Americans Essay\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n 1. Introduction\\n 2. Main Discussion\\n 3. Conclusion\\n 4. References\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nTo begin with, it is necessary to emphasize that the period of American independence was featured with the absence of rights for women and African Americans. They did not have even basic rights stipulated. It is claimed that even revolution did not guarantee equal rights to every American. However, the situation started changing in the 19 th century with the so-called market revolution. Forner (2005) emphasizes that  many white Americans could have look forward to a life of economic accumulation and individual advancement but large numbers of free blacks experience downward mobility. It is worth noting that free blacks from the north were the last group to experience indentured servitude since the terms of emancipation required children of slave mothers to work for their masters before being freed.렢\n\\nMain Discussion\\n\\nThe market revolution was intended to improve the financial position of African Americans and it is also regarded as the confirmation that African Americans did not have any financial and social opportunities at that time. Originally, these were not only the southerners who discriminated against the African Americans. The northerners were also denying the rights and opportunities for blacks and white women, however, on the other hand, some influential northerners supported emancipation. Anyway, according to Forner (2005)  the earlier ideology of republican motherhood which allowed women a kind of public roles as mothers of future citizens evolved subtly into the mid-nineteenth century as the cult of domesticity. As more men were leaving the home for work women did exercise considerable power over personal affairs within the family. The rapid decline in the American birthrate during the nineteenth century cannot be explained except by the conscious decision of millions of women to limit the number of children they bore. The idea of a domestic city minimized even women뗩 indirect participation in the outside world. To both genders, freedom meant fulfilling their respective inborn qualities.\\n\\nMen were regarded as rational, hostile, and dominant, while women were nurturing, selfless, ruled by their emotions and thus they were less fitting for public life. Men moved freely between public and private life spheres while women were supposed to remain cloistered in the private realm of the family. (Forner, 2005). As for nowadays, it should be stated that the treatment towards men and women stayed the same, however, there are much more exceptions from this rule nowadays. It emphasizes the development of the legislative base, which promotes social rights and financial opportunities for women. The same is with the blacks: they have much more opportunities, they have affirmative action (which is often called reverse discrimination), and they have an opportunity to lead the corporation, and now even to rule the country. It was impossible at least 50 years ago. It may seem that women at this time have all the necessary freedoms but however, some consider that it is rather a false perception. It is explained by the fact that women are still discriminated against and considered to be weaker than men.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nIn conclusion, it is necessary to emphasize that the market revolution offered numerous opportunities for African Americans and white women, though it offered opportunities that caused the essential division in the already divided community.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nFoner, E.
